<p><i>Editor&#8217;s note: This article <a href="https://ggwash.org/view/86815/dc-councils-transportation-committee-votes-yes-on-metro-for-dc-bill">originally appeared</a> on Greater Greater Washington and is republished with permission.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>DC Council took a step toward putting $100 per month on District residents’ SmarTrip cards Monday as the Committee on Transportation and the Environment voted unanimously in favor of the <a href="https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Legislation/B24-0429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro for DC Amendment Act of 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The program is designed to spur ridership and incentivize WMATA to deliver more reliable service by automatically enrolling all DC residents except for those with existing travel subsidies.</p>
<p>“For the essential worker who never stopped commuting and depends on the bus and train, this is going to be a much-needed boost to their family’s budget,” Councilmember Charles Allen (Ward 6), who introduced Metro for DC, said in a <a href="https://www.charlesallenward6.com/today_dc_council_committee_on_transportation_and_the_environment_to_vote_on_charles_allen_s_metro_for_dc_bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>. “And for residents who have more options, this will help bring more people back to the Metro.”</p>
<p>Allen added: “But I want to be clear: low-cost or free service isn’t worth much if the system doesn’t meet riders’ needs. That’s why Metro for DC pairs this monthly transit subsidy with millions each year to improve bus and transit &#8211; especially in underserved neighborhoods &#8211; to improve service, reliability, frequency, and quality of the rides residents need.”</p>
<p>WMATA, however, would only get money from the program if riders spent it at the faregates. Government funds would only be used if District residents redeem the credits, which would refresh at the end of each month and go unspent if eligible residents chose not to ride.</p>
<p>During markup, Councilmember Christina Henderson (At-large) noted that for some people, cost is an obstacle to riding Metrorail, but for many, it’s reliability. Henderson said that nothing is more distracting to riders or more of a blow to WMATA than announcing six weeks of track work.</p>
<p>Allen began working on the law before COVID decimated Metrorail ridership, which is still beleaguered by <a href="https://ggwash.org/view/82871/the-wheels-on-metros-7000-series-trains-may-not-have-been-put-on-securely-enough">mechanical issues</a>, <a href="https://ggwash.org/view/85964/metros-yellow-line-bridge-is-closing-for-seven-months-heres-what-you-need-to-know">construction delays</a>, and (non) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2022/09/03/return-to-office-pandemic-commute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commuting trends</a> in the pandemic’s third year.</p>
<p>Now, Allen says, winning back ridership is more important than ever.</p>
<p>“It was an important idea then, but now as we recover, it’s now an imperative. Metro’s success means the District’s success, and this bill can help bring riders back and close the system’s revenue gap,” Allen noted during the hearing.</p>
<p>During Monday’s markup meeting, committee Chair Mary Cheh (Ward 3) said that “the likely cost is, frankly, considerable,” citing an estimate that the program would cost $163 million in fiscal year 2025. She added, though, that “it’s not cheap, but the repayment to us as a community will be more than worth it.”</p>
<p>Allen explained that the bill would be funded “the way every bill is funded,” through unbudgeted increases to projected revenue identified by the District’s Chief Financial Officer after the council approves each year’s budget. Allen made a point of clarifying that unbudgeted revenue increases are different from the surplus revenue after the end of the fiscal year, meaning it will not impact money dedicated to the Housing Production Trust Fund.</p>
<p>The bill also provides a $10 million Transit Equity fund for WMATA and the District Department of Transportation to improve bus and streetcar service, and prioritize underserved areas where people are dependent on public transit.</p>
<p>In an email to GGWash, WMATA spokesperson Sherri Ly said “Metro appreciates legislative initiatives that provide funding and improve services. When customers choose Metro it’s better for the region and our environment. We welcome all initiatives that encourage customers to choose Metro.”</p>
<p>Committee members Allen, Henderson, and Janeese Lewis George (Ward 4) voted unanimously in favor of the bill — Kenyan McDuffie (Ward 5) was not present for the vote.</p>
<p>Erik Salmi, Deputy Chief of Staff for Charles Allen, said that he is confident that the bill will get through during this legislative session. “Folks are excited about it,” Salmi said, adding that the bigger thing to note is that if the legislation doesn’t pass this fall the process will start all over again.</p>
<p>The bill will now move onto the Committee of the Whole for further markup before two rounds of voting. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has not yet scheduled a hearing to consider Metro for DC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/bikebusiness.jpg?w=400"></p><!-- FeaturedImageEnd --><p>When New York City proposed installing a protected bike lane on Skillman Avenue in Queens in 2017, the impact it would have on local businesses was certain — at least according to the plan’s critics.</p>
<p>A devastating loss of customers. Revenue falling by 20 percent. Beloved shops forced to close their doors for good.</p>
<p>Those predictions were wrong.</p>
<p>Data obtained by Streetsblog through a Freedom of Information request shows the economy of Skillman Avenue grew after the city built the new lane in the fall of 2018, with revenue increasing and new businesses setting up shop.</p>
<p>Sales in the stores, bars and restaurants on Skillman’s main seven-block commercial stretch collectively rose by 12 percent after the lane went in, according to the data, which was provided by the city Department of Finance. There was also a net increase of three new businesses on the strip, a jump of 10 percent.</p>

<p>Today the main drag of the western Queens neighborhood is as lively as ever, with restaurants, bars, bodegas, and other mom-and-pop establishments doing brisk business. Some locals credit the new bike lane.</p>
<p>“It definitely helps,” said Mark O’Dowd, the manager of the P.J. Horgan’s bar on Skillman. “People drop their bikes here, they pop in for a beer.”</p>
<p>Streetsblog’s findings align with a growing body of research — including an oft-cited but nearly decade-old <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/dot-economic-benefits-of-sustainable-streets.pdf" rel="noopener">study</a> by the city Department of Transportation — showing that so-called active transportation infrastructure has a neutral or positive impact on local commerce. The data also challenge one of the most frequent arguments against new bike lanes — that they’ll hurt neighboring businesses — an argument that continues to surface in <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/11/01/anatomy-of-a-backtrack-dots-new-sunset-park-plan-gives-safety-to-some-double-parking-madness-for-others/" rel="noopener">new</a> disputes as the DOT <a href="https://projects.transalt.org/bikelanes" rel="noopener">endeavors</a> to fulfill a legal requirement to build 30 miles of protected bike lanes each year.</p>
<p>For one opponent of the Skillman bike lane, Streetsblog’s findings prompted a reconsideration of once firmly held beliefs.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to go with what the data tells you,” said Brent O’Leary, a local community leader who once <a href="https://sunnysidepost.com/sunnyside-resident-produces-video-calls-on-dot-to-scrap-the-protected-bike-lanes" rel="noopener">argued</a> that the lane had been a “real burden” on small businesses.</p>
<p>“If it shows that that wasn’t the case then I wouldn’t fight it,” O’Leary said in an interview this month. “If there’s good data I will always change my position.”</p>
<p>The city first <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/11/07/401670/" rel="noopener">proposed</a> building the Skillman Avenue bike lane — and another on parallel 43rd Avenue — in the fall of 2017 after drivers <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/04/03/alleged-drunk-unlicensed-hit-and-run-driver-kills-delivery-worker-as-nypd-targets-cyclists/" rel="noopener">killed</a> one cyclist and critically <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170411/sunnyside/pedestrian-struck-39th-street-43rd-avenue-fdny/" rel="noopener">injured</a> another in the area. The bloodshed sparked an outcry from safe streets advocates, the neighborhood’s then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer, and the <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/05/01/remembering-gelacio-reyes-father-of-3-struck-by-a-drunk-driver-while-biking-home-from-work/" rel="noopener">family</a> of Gelacio Reyes, the man who was killed. The DOT then developed a plan to redesign the streets with better sight lines at intersections, new pedestrian islands, reconfigured traffic lanes and, yes, protected bike lanes.</p>
<p>The backlash was extreme. Civic groups <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/07/26/bike-lane-opponents-put-on-a-good-show-last-night-but-theyre-still-short-on-facts/" rel="noopener">rallied</a> against the proposal. Opponents packed <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/03/27/all-eyes-on-van-bramer-after-town-hall-on-sunnyside-protected-bike-lanes/" rel="noopener">community</a> <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2018/6/8/17443130/queens-new-york-bike-lane-community-board-meeting" rel="noopener">meetings</a> that lasted hours. Van Bramer <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/06/20/jimmy-van-bramer-consummates-his-craven-reversal-on-protected-bike-lanes-for-sunnyside/" rel="noopener">waffled</a> on his position. A cyclist found <a href="https://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/anger-after-tacks-placed-on-bike-lane/article_b42da324-15b3-5f47-8460-e25caa1f2d66.html" rel="noopener">thumb tacks</a> scattered along four blocks of the new bike lane on 43rd Avenue.</p>
<p>Throughout the protracted dispute, opponents again and again made the same assertion: removing parking on Skillman to make way for street-safety features would hurt local merchants.</p>
<p>“They’re basically telling us they can’t continue doing business if they lose all that parking,” Denise Keehan-Smith, who chaired the local community board at the time, <a href="https://sunnysidepost.com/town-hall-bike-lanes-next-week-updated-proposal-skillman-43rd-avenues-presented" rel="noopener">said</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>“Protected bike lanes do not guarantee safer streets, but it will mean a loss of business,” Gary O’Neill, owner of the Aubergine Cafe on Skillman, <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/03/27/all-eyes-on-van-bramer-after-town-hall-on-sunnyside-protected-bike-lanes/" rel="noopener">said</a> a few months later.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>“Some of the stores have already said, at the end of August, they may not be able to last because the businesses have clients and cars,” <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/07/26/bike-lane-opponents-put-on-a-good-show-last-night-but-theyre-still-short-on-facts/" rel="noopener">said</a> Pat Dorfman, the head of an anti-bike-lane group.</p>
<p>The dire economic assumptions even factored into then-Rep. Joe Crowley’s opposition to the plan.</p>
<p>“Adding these bike lanes would have far too great of an economic cost and impact on our neighborhood,” he <a href="https://sunnysidepost.com/crowley-speaks-out-against-dots-skillman-43rd-avenues-proposal-day-before-cb2-vote" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in a statement.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Four years later, those grim predictions have not come to pass. Streetsblog’s analysis revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the spring of 2017, more than a year before the bike lane was installed, there were 31 retail or food service business that collectively made $3.11 million in taxable sales that quarter on Skillman Avenue between 45th and 52nd streets. By early 2020, there were 34 businesses that collectively made $3.47 million in the quarter.</li>
<li>By some measures, Skillman outperformed its surroundings. Streetsblog also obtained sales tax data from the same period for Queens as a whole and for a nearby stretch of Greenpoint Avenue that is similar in character to Skillman Avenue but has no protected bike lane. While new businesses were opening on Skillman Avenue, they were closing on Greenpoint Avenue, which lost a net of two businesses over the same period. Queens also lost businesses.</li>
<li>Skillman’s 12-percent increase in collective quarterly sales was greater than the increase in Queens as a whole (3 percent).</li>
</ul>
<p>By other measures, Skillman performed worse than its surroundings. The increase in collective quarterly sales was even greater on Greenpoint Avenue (16 percent) than on Skillman (12 percent). And Greenpoint Avenue and Queens enjoyed larger increases in quarterly sales when measured on a per-business basis. Each business on Skillman saw on average a $1,700 (2 percent) quarterly increase in sales, while the increase was $6,600 (6 percent) per business in Queens as a whole and $19,400 (20 percent) per business on Greenpoint Avenue.</p>

<p>As for street safety, other city <a href="https://crashmapper.org/#/" rel="noopener">data</a> shows the dangers on Skillman dropped dramatically on average for all road users after the bike lane was installed  — much as DOT said it would. Crashes on the avenue fell by 24 percent — and injuries from crashes by 28 percent — in the two years after the bike lane went in compared to the two years prior.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Greenpoint Avenue, crashes increased by 8 percent and injuries by 41 percent in that same period.</p>

<p>The Department of Transportation praised the developments on Skillman.</p>
<p>“The success of the Skillman Avenue protected bike lane shows the positive impact of street design improvements,” agency spokeswoman Mona Bruno said in a statement. “It’s thrilling to see the neighborhood flourish with safer and more sustainable streets.”</p>
<p>But even the rosy economic data was not enough to dissuade some former foes of the bike lane that it may not have been so bad after all.</p>
<p>Keehan-Smith, the former Community Board 2 chair who voted against the project, said she does not know whether she would vote differently today, even with the data showing business grew on the street following the lane’s construction.</p>
<p>Merchants at the time told her the lane would hurt their business, she said, “and so whatever they told me, I believed them.”</p>
<p>Danny Zhang, the owner of T.J. Asian Bistro on Skillman, was one such merchant, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/cars-travel-double-parked-bike-lanes/5183987/" rel="noopener">saying</a> in March 2019 that business dropped by 20 percent after the lane was installed — a figure he repeated in an interview earlier this month.</p>
<p>“For me, it really hurt,” he said of the bike lane. “Business is getting slower.”</p>

<p>Zhang was incredulous about the city data showing an overall increase in sales on the street since the lane went in. He said customers used to drive to his restaurant from Astoria and Jackson Heights, but they no longer do because they can’t find parking.</p>

<p>O’Neill and Dorfman did not respond to multiple requests to comment.</p>
<p>Streetsblog’s findings resonate with prior research on the subject. In 2013, DOT released its <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/dot-economic-benefits-of-sustainable-streets.pdf" rel="noopener">study</a> on the economic impact of bike lanes and other street redesign projects on neighboring businesses in the city and found that “improved accessibility and a more welcoming street environment created by these projects generate increases in retail sales in the project areas.”</p>
<p>And Jenny H. Liu, an economist at Portland State University who researches the issue, says study after study has reaffirmed the finding that bike lanes typically have a neutral to positive impact on nearby businesses.</p>
<p>“Walk-able and bike-able neighborhoods and commercial areas tend to attract a lot more foot traffic,” she said. Pedestrians and cyclists tend to patronize businesses more frequently than drivers, she added, and in the long run they tend to spend more, too.</p>
<p>Liu cautioned that the data obtained by Streetsblog does not indicate whether the Skillman bike lane directly helped or hurt neighboring businesses — only that the street’s economy grew after the lane was installed. To determine any causal connection, she said, other factors must be considered, including inflation, changes in employment and wages on the street, changes in the types of businesses opening and closing and any large investments in the area.</p>
<p>Still, the findings provided yet more evidence that the economic argument against bike lanes is flimsy — not that it’s likely to disappear from future bike lane battles.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>“Most people who fight this stuff are beyond facts and to some degree are participating in a culture war,” said Orcutt, the advocacy director of Bike New York and a former DOT official. “They need to be defeated, not convinced. And it’s really up to [DOT] Commissioner [Ydanis] Rodriguez and the mayor to lead on that, not to stick a finger in the wind and listen to people saying stuff that’s not factual.”</p>
<p><em>ABOUT THIS STORY</em></p>
<p><em>This story is based on Streetsblog’s analysis</em><em> of </em><em>sales tax data</em><em> obtained from the New York City Department of Finance</em><em> through a Freedom of Information request. </em><em>DOF received the data from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance</em><em> and aggregated it by study area to preserve the tax secrecy of individual businesses.</em></p>
<p><em>The Department of Finance charged Streetsblog $1,700 to provide the data, </em><em>saying it took the agency 35 hours to prepare. </em><em>While the New York State Freedom of Information Law allows agencies to charge for the production of records,</em><em> Rachael Fauss, a senior policy advisor for the good-government group Reinvent Albany, </em><em>criticized DOF’s decision to charge Streetsblog $1,700.</em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>“The more that records are inaccessible due to fees, the more it defeats the purpose of the Freedom of Information Law,” she said. “These are the public’s records, and getting charged for them is counter to public access.”</em></p>
<p><em>The Department of Finance’s annual budget is greater than $300 million. </em><em>Streetsblog is a non-profit newsroom with five full-time staff members.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Jacqueline Gold, a spokeswoman for the Department of Finance, did not respond to a request to comment on her agency’s decision to charge Streetsblog $1,700 for the data.</em></p>
<p><em>The study areas were: Skillman Avenue from 45th Street to 52nd Street, </em><em>Greenpoint Avenue from 41st Street to 48th Street, </em><em>and Queens as a whole. </em><em>The study period was from the first quarter of sales tax year 2018 (March 2017 through May 2017)</em><em> to the fourth quarter of sales tax year 2020 (December 2019 through February 2020). </em><em>The bike lane was installed between August and October 2018.</em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The businesses included in the data fall into two </em><em>North American Industry Classification System</em><em> categories:</em><em> Retail Trade (NAICS 44-45) </em><em>and Accommodation and Food Services (NAICS 72).</em></p>
<p><em>DOF excluded the top one percent of businesses in Queens based on taxable sales</em><em> per sale tax year so that outliers would not skew the results.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Despite Streetsblog’s request, DOF did not exclude businesses located on upper stories of buildings.</em></p>
<p><em>Some businesses may file taxes at an address other than a given place of business (e.g. businesses with multiple locations). For that reason, </em><em>the data provided by DOF may not include all retail, accommodation, and food service businesses located in the study areas, and it </em><em>may inadvertently include businesses registered to the study areas but operating elsewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>To identify</em><em> businesses in the study areas, DOF had to convert the addresses on sales tax returns into their borough-block-lot codes. Because of issues with the data, DOF said it could not convert roughly 30 percent of business addresses in the city.</em></p>
<p><em>DOF could not estimate the number of businesses inadvertently excluded from or included in the data it provided due to the limitations described above.<br />

<p>&#8220;Work is well under way at the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA), the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the California Transportation Commission to align funding programs in the bill with CAPTI, with several actions already completed,&#8221; wrote Newsom in his veto statement.</p>
<p>While that work is indeed underway, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily follow that making it a statutory requirement is unnecessary. For one example, look at <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2019/08/30/breaking-down-caltrans-cost-estimate-of-the-complete-streets-bill/">how long it took Caltrans</a> to see the importance of complete streets in its work. <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2022/01/14/questions-and-some-answers-about-caltrans-new-complete-streets-directive/">Caltrans is working to incorporate complete streets strategies into its policies and planning now</a>, but just getting to this beginning stage that took years of work and <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2022/02/24/caltrans-officially-embraces-safe-systems-approach/">multiple iterations of executive-level policy directives</a> &#8211; which were ignored at first &#8211; as well as strong leadership. And those efforts could quickly fizzle out if a new governor or a new head of Caltrans lost interest in them.</p>
<p>Putting the requirement to align funding programs with existing state climate policy into statute would only strengthen the state&#8217;s commitment to fighting climate change.</p>
<p>“We are deeply disappointed that A.B. 2438 was not signed into law,&#8221; wrote <a href="https://www.climateplan.org/">ClimatePlan</a> in a statement. &#8220;We saw A.B. 2438 as an opportunity to solidify all the work the administration has been doing on climate issues. This bill would have aligned transportation investments with our climate goals. We see this as a necessary step towards reducing emissions, cleaning our air, and investing in our future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill, the advocates pointed out, was one attempt to address findings from <a href="https://climateplan.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7ee52d07d37f78d3ebaa600e1&amp;id=197b990d3e&amp;e=d9889bf56a">the A.B. 285 report</a> that showed that <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2022/03/10/legislative-report-says-align-transportation-money-with-climate-goals-now-how/">only a tiny percentage of California’s annual billion-dollar transportation budget aligns with the state’s climate goals</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the influx of federal dollars coming in from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), California must align its transportation dollars with our climate goals. Our tax dollars cannot be continuously spent on polluting and inequitable transportation infrastructure projects that will undermine our state’s climate, health, and equity goals,&#8221; ClimatePlan wrote.</p>
<p>Of deep concern is something else in Newsom&#8217;s veto statement. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CalSTA is committed to reviewing outcomes and integrating public feedback in future years to make modifications to CAPTI, as necessary, to meet the needs of the statewide transportation system. Linking these programs in statute to a specific iteration of this plan inhibits the state&#8217;s ability to appropriately respond to the evolution of the state&#8217;s response to climate change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A.B. 2438 did not focus on linking to any &#8220;specific iteration&#8221; of CAPTI, but to CAPTI itself, which would presumably mean including any new information or changes. The document has been described as a &#8220;living document&#8221; for exactly that reason &#8211; so that needed changes can be incorporated as more information becomes available and new technologies are deployed.</p>
<p>But more worrying than that: <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2021/04/14/state-climate-action-plan-for-transportation-infrastructure-joint-agency-discussion-workshops/">CAPTI has received a lot of pushback on its strategies</a>, especially where they provide clear policy direction asserting that continuing to build highways will not help California meet its climate goals. Newsom writes that future public feedback will modify CAPTI &#8220;to meet the needs of the statewide transportation system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does this mean the highway lobby has plans to weaken CAPTI?</p>
<p>That is more of an argument for signing the bill, Governor Newsom, than for vetoing it.</p>

<p>On November 8, San Francisco voters will decide the fate of the 1.5 miles of safe, healthy space on JFK Drive in Golden Gate Park that was created early in the pandemic. Although city leaders voted to make this space permanent in April, it’s now on the ballot in response to an opposing measure – Measure I. Measure I would take away what’s now called ‘JFK Promenade’ (among other things).</p>
<p><strong>We are counting on everyone who loves car-free JFK to help get the word out to vote YES on J, YES on N, and NO on I.</strong></p>

<p>A project to put protected bike lanes on Hopkins Street is running into pushback from merchants represented by Councilmember Sophie Hahn of Berkeley District 5. She is calling on the city to delay and restudy the project, even though it was <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/05/11/new-bike-lanes-north-berkeley-hopkins-street" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved last May</a>. As explained on Bike Walk Berkeley&#8217;s Twitter feed:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hahn’s asking for $400K to study a few blocks of Hopkins that have ALREADY been studied and Council-approved. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>At least Hahn is honest that this is purely about parking: <a href="https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/legislative-body-meeting-attachments/2022-09-28%20Agenda%20Committee%20TC%20Item%20-%20Hopkins%20Reconsideration%20Item.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her letter to the council</a> states clearly that she thinks parking considerations are on the same level of importance as whether or not cyclists are killed or maimed. &#8220;A major impetus for the Hopkins Corridor study and improvements is to significantly improve pedestrian and bike safety, but business and community-supporting elements were always intended to have<em> equal</em> [emphasis added] and simultaneous consideration.&#8221; And, yes, in context &#8220;business and community-supporting elements&#8221; just means parking.</p>
<p>The hard-working advocates at Walk Bike Berkeley are urging Berkeley residents to <a href="https://berkeleyca.gov/your-government/city-council/council-roster#:~:text=You%20can%20get%20in%20touch,Milvia%20Street%2C%20Berkeley%2C%20CA%2094704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call their electeds on the city council</a> to urge them to vote &#8220;no&#8221; on a delay to this important safety project.</p>

<p>Advocates celebrated the passage Wednesday of a new transit-oriented development policy by the MTC. The <a href="https://mtc.ca.gov/news/mtc-adopts-landmark-policy-promote-housing-commercial-development-near-transit-stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MTC&#8217;s release</a> states that the new policies will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;boost the overall housing supply and increase residential densities in transit-rich areas throughout the Bay Area; spur more commercial development near transit hubs served by multiple agencies; promote bus transit, walking, biking and shared mobility in transit-rich areas; and foster partnerships to create transit-oriented communities where people of all income levels, racial and ethnic backgrounds, ages and ability levels can live, work and thrive. The new policy, which replaces a Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Policy originally adopted by the Commission in 2005 and then updated several times in subsequent years, applies specifically to areas within a half-mile of BART, Caltrain, SMART, Capitol Corridor and ACE stations; Muni and VTA light-rail stations; Muni and AC Transit bus rapid transit stops; and ferry terminals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s a huge step toward the transformation we need around good transit stations, particularly when combined with AB2097 and AB2011 which fill some holes that were created by TOC policy compromises,&#8221; wrote Jonathon Kass, Transportation Policy Manager for SPUR, in an email to Streetsblog.</p>
<p>“Using transportation funds as an incentive, the policy encourages cities and counties to upzone transit-rich areas so transit, walking and biking can be viable travel choices for more people, and so we can generate maximum value from the billions of taxpayer dollars that have been invested in our transit network over the years as well as new transit lines that will be built in the years to come,&#8221; wrote MTC Chair and Napa County Supervisor Alfredo Pedroza in a statement. &#8220;The policy specifically encourages the development of affordable housing and protects current residents from being displaced by new development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Streetsblog will have more on the significance of this change in an upcoming post.</p>

<p><i style="font-weight: 400">Editor&#8217;s note: This article was written in response to our coverage of National Roundabouts Week 2022. <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/category/national-roundabout-week/">Read</a></i><i style="font-weight: 400"> the other articles in the series here. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As roundabouts decrease traffic deaths for drivers, some designs of the controversial traffic treatment may actually <em style="font-weight: 400">increase </em>non-deadly collisions for people on bikes. while scaring others off riding entirely, a series of studies suggests — and its raising thorny questions about who might get hurt along the road to Vision Zero.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">As part of an ongoing study of the safety impacts of roundabouts, University of Utah-based researchers Patrick Singleton and Nirajan Poudel surveyed 49 studies from roughly a dozen countries and concluded that, on the aggregate, roundabouts may actually increase crashes between bicyclists and drivers — and in some cases, they increase serious injuries and deaths of people on two wheels, too.</p>
<figure style="width: 349px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="" src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/04/Magic-Roundabout3.jpg" width="349" height="218" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Multi-lane, multi-directional roundabouts with no protected space for cyclists, like the &#8220;Magic Roundabout&#8221; in Swindon, England, obviously do not rank well on biking safety metrics. Photo: <a href="https://inhabitat.com/this-insane-traffic-roundabout-in-england-will-make-your-head-spin/">Inhabitat</a></figcaption></figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The operative word in that sentence, of course, is &#8220;may&#8221; — and Singleton is careful to point out that not all roundabouts are created equal. Researchers in Belgium, for instance, recorded a staggering 93 percent increase in injury crashes at the intersections that weren&#8217;t outfitted with accompanying protected bike lanes; meanwhile, Danish researchers studied roundabouts that <em>did </em>have separated lanes, and logged an almost-as-staggering 84 percent <em>reduction </em>in crashes. United States academics, by contrast, often struggled to draw <em>any</em> definitive conclusions, because there were so few roundabouts, crashes, or even simply <em>bicyclists </em>in U.S. communities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">But Singleton still says that roundabout safety deserves more scrutiny, particularly in light of the many studies in their sample that examined how unsafe cyclists <em>feel </em>when riding in many of them. Though actual crash data is often treated as the gold standard of safety metrics, <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/207225/v675poster.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">other research shows</a> that low levels of &#8220;perceived safety&#8221; can dissuade people not just from riding at a certain intersection, but from riding <em>entirely. </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We took a very broad and loose definition of &#8216;safety&#8217; in this review,&#8221; Singleton added. &#8220;The end goal of Vision Zero, of course, is that we want to reduce injuries and deaths on our roadways. But the process of getting there matters, so we wanted to assess perceptions of comfort and safety as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>In subsequent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.023">studies,</a> Singleton and Poudel looked more deeply into cyclists&#8217; perceptions of roundabout safety, interviewing 600 U.S. riders about what specific designs were most appealing to them and analyzing commonalities between their preferences.</p>
<p>The most popular options, they found, had &#8220;one (rather than two) lanes, lower traffic volumes, and more robust bicycle facilities — especially separated bicycle lanes (a &#8216;protected roundabout&#8217;).&#8221;</p>
<p>Which is, to put it bluntly, pretty much nothing like what the average U.S. roundabout looks like at all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Current design guidance in the U.S. basically says to either let cyclists take the lane like a driver, or give them a ramp to ride up on the sidewalk,&#8221; Singleton added. &#8220;But our study suggests neither of those are desirable to bicyclists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the reason, Singleton says, is what psychologists call <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20043758/drivers-dont-see-cyclists-inattentional-blindness/">&#8220;inattentional blindness,&#8221;</a> when drivers physically <em>see </em>someone unexpected — like a cyclist riding right along next to them, or even on a sidewalk— but their brains fail to truly <em>register </em>that the unexpected person is there, because the environment doesn&#8217;t clearly signal that they belong.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I’m a driver, I expect to mostly see things in the driving lane that are about the same size and speed as a car,&#8221; Singleton adds. &#8220;Needless to say, that’s not what a cyclist looks like at all. &#8230; As engineers and planners, we need to understand that &#8216;looking&#8217; and &#8216;seeing&#8217; are different things, and we need to design intersections to highlight vulnerable road users in many different ways.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_229547" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229547" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Bicycle-roundabout.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-229547 size-full" sizes="(min-width: 80em) 640px,(min-width: 64em) and (max-width: 80em) 640px,(min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 64em) 640px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 64em) 640px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 48em) 640px,(max-width: 32em) 512px,(max-width: 48em) 640px,640px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Bicycle-roundabout.jpeg?w=640&amp;h=427 640w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Bicycle-roundabout.jpeg?w=512&amp;h=342 512w" alt="A roundabout bike lane in Dungavaran, Ireland.

<p>Singleton — who is also a civil engineer himself — says that in addition to protected lanes, lots of signs and pavement markings, as well as good setbacks can also help ensure motorists don&#8217;t strike bikers even when they&#8217;re looking right at them.</p>
<p>But he also recognizes that great roundabouts that incorporate those recommendations can be significantly more expensive and complicated to install — and that even some imperfect ones can significantly cut crash<em> severity</em> when compared to signalized intersections, if not always crash <em>volumes</em> themselves. How transportation leaders negotiate those tradeoffs in the context of a Vision Zero plan, though, is a complicated political question that Singleton says it&#8217;s up to others to answer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I’m lucky that I’m the researcher and not the policymaker,&#8221; he laughs. &#8220;Hopefully I can provide information, and they can wrestle with those kinds of dilemmas. In the U.S., we’ve had quite a bit of experience to suggest that roundabouts are safer in a lot of situations. My best recommendation now is, let&#8217;s make them even better for bicyclists.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s down to the wire. Governor Gavin Newsom has until midnight Friday to work through the pile of bills on his desk. Recently <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/09/28/california-to-build-more-housing-faster/">he signed a slew of bills on housing</a>, giving cause for celebration to housing advocates, who <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdzLPFlUoAA4KJy?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096">note a steady shift in the way housing will be planned and built</a> in California.</p>
<p><strong>Vetoed</strong></p>
<p>Governor Newsom also refused to sign several bills. One of these was held over from last year: <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB117">A.B. 117</a> from Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas). This bill <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2021/07/09/update-e-bike-incentives-are-funded-policy-bill-will-add-equity-guidelines/">would have made the e-bike incentive program permanent and eligible for ongoing funding</a>, similar to several programs for electric cars. <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2021/07/09/update-e-bike-incentives-are-funded-policy-bill-will-add-equity-guidelines/">Last year&#8217;s state budget set aside $10 million</a> to create the e-bike incentive program &#8211; <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2022/07/19/where-is-californias-e-bike-incentive-program-part-2/">which is still being formulated</a> &#8211; but vetoing this bill threatens to make it a one-time-only opportunity for a few people. Like other bills he has rejected, Newsom uses the budget as an excuse to reject this program [<a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/09/AB-117-VETO.pdf">PDF</a>] &#8211; even though it currently has money and is currently under development.</p>
<p>Newsom also vetoed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB457">S.B. 457</a>, from Senator Anthony Portantino (D-La Cañada Flintridge), <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2022/06/06/new-bill-would-create-an-incentive-to-go-car-free-in-california/">who was looking for a way to reward people for not owning a car</a>. Portantino wanted to create a personal income tax credit of $1,000 for households that own fewer than one car per adult. According to his veto statement [<a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/09/SB-457-VETO.pdf">PDF</a>], Newsom rejected the bill because it would cost the state &#8220;nearly one billion dollars.&#8221; Consistent with other recent vetoes, he writes that &#8220;bills with a significant fiscal impact, such as this measure, should be considered and accounted for as part of the annual budget process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another of Portantino&#8217;s bills was also rejected: <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1136">S.B. 1136</a> would have required public agencies to perform a CEQA review of any &#8220;reasonably foreseeable methods&#8221; that might be used to meet required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or other pollution. It would also impose labor requirements on work done to meet those required reductions. Senator Portantino says the bill was meant to streamline CEQA processes by having the state agency perform analysis on new technologies and thus eliminate potentially duplicate analyses.</p>
<p>Again, Newsom objected to the costs involved [<a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2022/09/SB-1136-VETO.pdf">PDF</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Signed</strong></p>
<p>Governor Newsom did, however, sign <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2022/04/27/bill-would-require-bicycle-and-pedestrian-safety-in-general-plans/">another key bill</a> from Senator Portantino: <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB932">S.B. 932</a>, which <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2022/02/09/new-portantino-legislation-would-force-better-transportation-planning-in-california-cities/">requires cities and counties</a> to incorporate <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/safety/zero-deaths">a Safe Systems Approach</a> into their General Plans. It also requires them &#8220;to develop bicycle plans, pedestrian plans, and traffic calming plans based on the policies and goals in the circulation element that, among other things, sets goals for initiation and completion of all actions identified in the plans within 25 years of the date of adoption of the modified circulation element, as specified.&#8221;</p>
<p>To give it some teeth &#8211; since General Plans are notoriously slow to be updated &#8211; the new law also requires them &#8220;to begin implementation of the plan within two years of the date of adoption of the plan, to regularly review its progress towards completing implementation of the modified circulation element, and to consider revising the circulation element if it determines it will not reach the goals of the bicycle, pedestrian, or traffic calming plans within 25 years of the date of adoption of the modified circulation element.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more legislative updates as they dribble out of the Governor&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>In six weeks voters throughout the Bay Area will be heading to the polls (if they haven&#8217;t already voted by mail by then). Where do the many candidates stand on transit, cycling, safe streets, housing, and other things in Streetsblog&#8217;s realm?</p>
<p>Twelve of the Bay Area&#8217;s advocacy organizations joined forces and sent questionnaires to candidates from Alameda, San Francisco, Contra Costa, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. They have published the responses. From Seamless Bay Area, which is hosting the results of the &#8220;Sustainable Transportation Candidate Questionnaire&#8221; on <a href="https://www.seamlessbayarea.org/2022-candidate-questionnaire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its web page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was was sent to hundreds of candidates across the San Francisco Bay Area in September 2022 so that voters could be more informed.</p>
<p>This first-ever questionnaire got a huge response &#8211; 155 candidates for office from 60 jurisdictions in 5 counties around the San Francisco Bay Area responded. Their responses are now available in this <a href="https://bit.ly/TranspoAnswers2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Drive link</a>, sorted by county and jurisdiction. The data can also be <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kw5qTWAI6MvWM5_tjNbfgB7JlHH29vc3AsgxA7RX9m4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloaded as a spreadsheet here</a>, if community groups wish to republish responses on their websites or compare responses more easily from different candidates.</p>

<p>There were nine questions in total, but here are a few for an idea of what they asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>What forms of transportation, including transit and active transportation (bicycling, walking, scooters, wheelchair), do you use on a regular basis and for what types of trips?</li>
<li>Transportation is the largest single source of carbon emissions in California, and in the Bay Area, and the largest share of transportation emissions come from single occupancy vehicles. What do you see as the quickest and most cost-effective way to achieve substantial reduction in transportation-related GHG emissions? And if elected, what actions would you prioritize to bring about a substantial reduction in transportation emissions?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/California-traffic-deaths-spiked-for-second-year-17183304.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traffic violence and deaths in California are increasing annually</a>; in 2021, 4,258 people died in vehicle crashes, a 10.7 percent increase from the prior year. If elected, what will you do to reverse the trend, increase street safety, save lives and reduce injuries in our community? What policies or specific projects would make the greatest impact?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before sending in their ballots, voters should <a href="https://www.seamlessbayarea.org/2022-candidate-questionnaire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out the results of the survey</a> and find out where the candidates for each district stand on transit, bike infrastructure, and more.</p>

<p><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0" class="mce_SELRES_start">?</span></p>
<p><strong>Jeff Wood: A couple weeks ago, I got emails from your team about what’s going on in Broward County, including MAP Broward. I’m curious a little bit more about the Mobility Advancement Program and, and how you are trying to implement that.</strong></p>
<p>Greg Stuart: The Mobility Advancement Program is the implementation of a penny surtax down here for transportation. Our agency got really tired of &#8230; look[ing] at this map behind me, our transit-systems plan, and say[ing], hey, you know, we could do this: We could do buses and exclusive lanes. We could put a light-rail system down; we could do a streetcar system! And it would always be, &#8220;we don’t have the money. We don’t have the money. We don’t have the money.&#8221; So my board basically directed me to go figure out how to get the money. There’s always so much money you can get outta Washington, but we needed to have a local pot.</p>
<p>So we spent a good seven years through a program called &#8220;Speak Up, Broward,&#8221; and we would go out to communities and talk about the importance of transportation and ways to fund a system, ways to pay for a light-rail system, ways to pay for a heavy-rail system. And it always came back to, well, you know, you have the ability to tax rental cars and you can tax license tags. But what really generates the money is sales tax, because it not only taxes the people that are here, but we have a very robust tourist trade, not like Disney, but still robust enough.</p>
<p>We actually have probably one of the largest mega yacht sales every year in the world — where people come here and buy these yachts that are $350 million and more, and they all get a percentage tax on ’em; it’s all great. So that world, I don’t understand [it], but it’s all good.</p>
<p><strong>Wood: I don’t understand that world.</strong></p>
<p>Stuart: When people call me to complain, I’m like, listen, give [it] a chance&#8230;. The public, the private sector before I got here, went out for a surtax for a really robust transit system. It failed. We worked with the cities and the county for a 50/50, or a half penny for transit and a half penny for infrastructure. Unfortunately, they tied it together, and that language was awful.</p>
<p>But the penny for transportation passed and the penny for infrastructure failed. The reason we had divided it up in that way is because the cities needed to redo their roads and all the rest of the necessary parts to support a bus-rapid-transit system, the things that you need to have in place. So that failed. And it was tied together. Both things had to pass to pass the ballot. Language for transit was. .. yes or no. And [do] you agree to raise by 1 cent or half a cent? The other language for infrastructure said, do you support increasing your tax by 0.05 percent for sales tax for infrastructure?</p>
<p>And then it wasn’t a yes or no. It was all in the yes or no box. And it failed, obviously. [In] our focus groups that we did afterward actually the voters said, &#8220;I voted no for that because I thought you were raising our sales tax by 5 cents because of the way it was written. And it was really kind of interesting because it was .05 percent. It took me a while to understand that, but then &#8230; I could see where that would confuse somebody. So then the third time we went out, which was the charm, with the county. It was for a full penny for transportation, period, which is what established the MAP program.</p>
<p>That actually passed in almost the super majority there. We said that there was going to be about 27 miles of light rail, but didn’t identify where we had identified a whole bunch of projects, didn’t say which and when. It was a really interesting thing to see pass, because it was completely counterintuitive to what everybody tells you and how a surtax should work. I met with my colleagues from around the country when we were moving forward with that. And I’m like, it’s really hard to say this to people because we’re always so busy going around, you have to show exactly where that station’s going to be and what that system’s going to look like and where the start and the stop and the points and this and the other.</p>
<p>Basically the voters in Broward said, &#8220;no, I don’t care. Take this money and do something with it.&#8221; And that’s what created the MAP program which is, to be honest with you, probably one of the greatest achievements I can say that has happened down here in probably a good 20 to 30 years. Because that actually has opened up our communities, not only to be able to self-fund projects, but also leverage a lot of this infrastructure [money] that’s coming out of Washington, thankfully, to advance a bunch of transit projects. So the map behind me may not exactly be the exact map that they’re going to build, but it stimulated the conversation in the community enough to say, yeah, we want something and I don’t care; get it done.</p>
<p>We were excited to see that pass. Obviously, the county was extremely excited. The money actually sits with the county commission, the way Florida law is written. It has been a real positive thing. Our partners in Hillsborough County, in the Tampa Bay Area, they also had a half-penny sales tax that they did, but it ended up being deemed unconstitutional because they were putting the money &#8230; in different agencies&#8217; pots and different city pots. The State Supreme court called that unconstitutional. So basically the way we’ve done it here in Broward now, the way it’s written and passed, that leaves it to be constitutional.</p>
<p>It really is the County Commissioners&#8217; money and their decision points. So, [we are] working with the county administrator, Monica Shapiro, who I would’ve loved to be on with me today. We’re working together to try to figure out things to get built and what moves forward. So the Broward County part of the Coastal Link project, where in Miami Dade, they call it their smart plant, the Northeast Corridor, we are ready to rock and roll with that. You know, we have the CapEx money put together. There is the operating money already put together. So we’re able to go and we’re going to be putting that into &#8220;Small Starts,&#8221; &#8230; to move forward with that corridor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/IMG_7407-2.jpg?w=465"></p><!-- FeaturedImageEnd --><p style="font-weight: 400">The automatic emergency braking systems that will soon come standard on nearly all new cars don&#8217;t reliably prevent crashes at the higher speeds at which the overwhelming majority of roadway deaths occur, a new study finds — and pedestrian-specific braking systems need further scrutiny, too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Researchers from the American Automobile Association studied four major automakers&#8217; versions of the popular safety technology to the test, with a particular focus on the high-speed collision scenarios that are common on deadly U.S. roads, but uncommon in federal crash test labs.</p>
<p>At 30 miles per hour, all four of the cars — which were made by Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, and Toyota, respectively — were usually able to prevent rear-end collisions, with 17 out of 20 (85 percent) test runs avoiding a crash entirely. And in the three crashes that <em>did occur</em>, the vehicles were still able to slow themselves an average of 86 percent in the moments before impact, to a point when it&#8217;d be far less likely for someone to get hurt.</p>
<p>At 40 miles per hour, things got a little dicier. The cars were only able to avoid a rear collision about 30 percent of the time, though fortunately, average crash speeds were reduced substantially in the process.</p>
<p>Even at slower speeds, though, the Automatic Emergency Braking Systems didn&#8217;t prevent <em>any </em>crashes when faced with other common collision scenarios, like a vehicle making a left turn in front of them, or crossing their path at a perpendicular (also known as a T-bone crash). All three scenarios are particularly common on wide, fast arterial roads running through countless U.S. communities, which are typically signed at 35 miles per hour or more but experience far-faster speeds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which sets performance standards for vehicle technology, typically only evaluates the efficacy of automatic emergency braking systems at test speeds under 25 miles per hour, because it&#8217;s long been believed that the tech will perform just as well at higher velocities, or that higher-speed crashes might cause vehicle sensors to dislodge and invalidate the tests. Groups like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, though, have <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/iihs-eyes-higher-speed-test-for-automatic-emergency-braking">questioned</a> whether regulators can afford to make those assumptions, considering that groups like AAA say that 90 percent of traffic deaths happen on roads with speed limits over <em>40 </em>miles per hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We as an organization, as well as myself personally, are fully on board with the potential of this technology, as well as the current level of effectiveness in terms of what we’ve already seen in rear end crashes,&#8221; said Matthew Lum, an automotive technical engineer for AAA. &#8220;We just want to ensure that this technology is eventually realized to its greatest potential.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, that still seems to be a long ways off.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Automatic Emergency Braking Systems, or AEBS, have been around since way back in 2003, but have largely been sold to consumers as a pricey add-on, leaving researchers with little data about how well the tech handles real-world road conditions.</p>
<figure style="width: 349px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="" src="https://www.thewindscreenco.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/01-Automated-Emergency-Braking-1000x1271.png" width="349" height="444" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">How AEB works with forward collision warning systems.

<p style="font-weight: 400">In 2016, though, a staggering 22 automakers representing 99 percent of the U.S. market <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-auto-safety-20160317-story.html">voluntarily agreed</a> to make the safety feature standard across all new models by the end of September 2022 — yes, this month — and on new trucks over 8,501 pounds by 2025. By the end of last year, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/most-new-cars-have-aeb-safety-tech-that-prevents-crashes-a4660106723/">12 of them</a> had already done it, and Consumer Reports says that 83 percent of model year 2022 cars have AEB on board.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pledge had a catch. Per NHTSA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwju2aeQ8rf6AhUbk4kEHewGCn4QFnoECAkQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2FAEB_FactSheet_031616.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2fYmbjS46nLiTEon0UifEm">rock-bottom standards,</a> the AEB systems the automakers&#8217; sold only needed to achieve &#8220;a speed reduction of at least 10 miles per hour in either&#8230; 12 or 25 mile per hour tests, or a speed reduction of five miles per hour in both of the tests&#8221; — even though, as pretty much every street safety advocate knows, those ultra-slow speeds are incredibly uncommon on U.S. roads, and <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/05/31/3-graphs-that-explain-why-20-mph-should-be-the-limit-on-city-streets/">unlikely to injure someone</a> even if a robo-car <em>doesn&#8217;t </em>intervene.</p>
<p>Happily, AAA&#8217;s tests found that the four cars did perform well at slightly higher speeds than that — at least when it came to crashes with other drivers.</p>
<p>But the researchers didn&#8217;t test whether cars were able to reliably stop in the presence of walkers, since <em>pedestrian </em>automatic emergency braking systems (PAEBS) were notably excluded from the 2022 pledge that inspired the study.</p>
<p>Other studies have <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/02/04/study-automatic-braking-doesnt-work-on-dark-streets-where-one-third-of-peds-deaths-happen/">shown,</a> though, that PAEBS make no difference at all at speeds over 50 miles her hour, on unlit roads after dark, or in <a href="https://www.fundacionmapfre.org/en/education-outreach/road-safety/adas-systems/types/autonomous-emergency-braking/pedestrian/">inclement weather</a> — and even when conditions are perfect, they still only cut collisions by about a third.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgGg4TNvhME?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=57&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>NHTSA has signaled that it is <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/03/08/fed-vehicle-safety-rating-update-wont-get-megacars-off-the-road/">primarily investigating</a> fallible technological solutions like PAEBS to fulfill a new mandate from Congress to include pedestrian safety in the New Cars Assessment Program, rather than exploring the possibility of regulating excessive vehicle size and weight, aggressive front-end design, and other factors that experts say are <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2021/07/27/study-americas-suv-jag-spurred-pedestrian-death-surge/">driving today&#8217;s pedestrian death crisis</a>.</p>
<p>To add insult to literal roadway injury, automakers tend to market PAEBS as a convenient way for drivers to avoid the inconvenience of striking <a href="https://twitter.com/streetsblogkea">obnoxious jaywalkers, irresponsible children and pedestrians with their heads in the clouds</a>, rather than as a life-saving tool that can complement, but not replace, drivers&#8217; efforts to  keep other road users safe.</p>

<p>With Automatic Emergency Braking systems already installed on most new cars, the AAA researchers say its critical that consumers learn about the limitations of today&#8217;s technology, even as the industry works to improve it. That, ideally, would mean automakers would issue simple, accessible &#8220;quick-start&#8221; guides to advanced vehicle safety features and require dealers to instruct new car buyers to read them, rather than burying important safety advisories in the fine print of a lengthy owner&#8217;s manual.</p>
<p>And they also say that automakers need to reframe how they sell automated technology more broadly: not as a cool new widget that can help you <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2021/11/05/three-more-toxiccarads-that-didnt-quite-make-the-cut/">rock out to Queen hands-free</a> behind the wheel,  but as a safety backstop that can help, but can&#8217;t always be relied upon, to save lives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The most common sense and easy to understand advice that we can give the general public is to simply pretend that your car doesn’t even have AEB,&#8221; added Lum. &#8220;Of course it’s great to have as a last resort, but drivers shouldn’t use this technology as a crutch in any sort of way. &#8230; They still need to be on alert for crashes at all times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caltrain did a public unveiling of its first new electric train sets on Saturday at 4th and King Street Station in San Francisco. &#8220;This is our first taste of what the riders can expect,&#8221; Michelle Bouchard, Executive Director of Caltrain, told Streetsblog during the event. Of course, the new cars are just the most visible piece of <a href="https://www.caltrain.com/news/cost-caltrain-electrification-increases-project-track-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $2.4 billion electrification project, which should be completed in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.caltrain.com/news/caltrain-debuts-its-new-electric-trains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Caltrain release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new high-performance trains will offer a better service to Caltrain riders. They will generate much less noise than their diesel equivalent, making the trip more enjoyable both for riders and residents that live near Caltrain tracks. The new vehicles also offer enhanced amenities, including new digital onboard displays, power outlets at each forward-facing seat, a new seat color palette selected by the public, energy-efficient lighting, coat hooks, security cameras, and expanded storage under the cantilevered seats.</p>
<p>Additionally, each trainset will have seven cars, as opposed to the current five or six. The new trains also accelerate and decelerate faster than their diesel alternatives, which must be pulled by a locomotive. This will allow Caltrain to expand its service levels beyond the current 104 trains every weekday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The Bay Area is the high-tech capital of the world, and it deserves a transportation system that reflects that,” said Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, during a press conference held at the Caltrain depot on King Street. “The tracks that were laid in the time of the steam engine will carry modern, electric trains along the Peninsula, perfectly symbolizing our spirit of innovation and dynamic change.”</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2021/08/06/barts-new-trains-still-have-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BART&#8217;s &#8220;fleet of the future&#8221; modernization project</a>, Caltrain is able to use standard, off-the-shelf rolling stock. The trains, while assembled in the U.S., are just a variant of the ubiquitous Stadler KISS from Switzerland. Stadler has sold over 1,000 such trains, which are capable of 110 mph, in countries throughout Europe (and Streetsblog has ridden them on several occasions). They run on standard-gauge tracks and use 25 kilovolts of electricity, which means in the future Caltrain will be able to swap equipment and do joint-orders with other American passenger railroads that use electric trains on the East Coast and in Chicago and Denver.</p>

<p>This use of standard equipment opens another possibility: Bouchard told Streetsblog that Caltrain is currently talking with Stadler about adding some hybrid trains to the order that can also run on batteries or hydrogen in addition to overhead electrification. That means some time after Caltrain electrification is completed between Tamien and San Francisco, it may become possible to run some non-diesel, one-seat services from San Francisco all the way to Gilroy. She even said there may eventually be Caltrain services as far south as Salinas. As reported, <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2016/07/07/its-a-go-for-caltrain-electrification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caltrain&#8217;s contract is for 96 train cars, with an option to purchase 20 more</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cyclists got a look at Caltrain&#8217;s new bike cars, which include several seats that will allow riders to keep an eye on their steeds. There are <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2019/06/07/caltrain-unswayed-by-pleas-for-secure-bike-space-on-new-fleet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two bike cars per train, still fewer than hoped for by bike advocates and something that was a contentious issue when the cars were in development</a>.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of years Caltrain will be testing these trains and receiving more rolling stock until 75 percent of the existing, diesel-hauled fleet is retired (those old belching beasts will continue to operate on trains to and from Gilroy for a while). According to Caltrain, electrification of the 51 miles from San Francisco to Tamien will increase its capacity the equivalent of adding 5.5 new lanes to 101.</p>

<p><b>Public transit unlocks jobs, education, recreation, and other essential services for thousands of people across the country. But slow and unreliable service reduces access to opportunities for those who need it the most. Automated bus lane enforcement is a powerful tool to take back road space for transit riders. </b></p>
<p>COVID-19 made it clear to the public how essential public transit is to communities of color and low-income neighborhoods. During the pandemic, neighborhoods with a higher proportion of people in poverty and of Hispanic people experienced <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S204604302100085X"><span style="font-weight: 400">fewer reductions in transit ridership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> than high-income neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p>Additionally, in <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/transit-ridership-dropped-heavy-rail-stations-during-covid-19-pandemic-ridership-change-depended-neighborhood-characteristics"><span style="font-weight: 400">an analysis of COVID-19 transit ridership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Yonah Freemark for the Urban Institute, communities with more Black residents, lower median incomes, and more working-class jobs “lost fewer riders on average than communities with few Black residents, high incomes, and many college-educated residents.” </span></p>
<p>Public transit is essential to equitable access to opportunities, and buses specifically are a huge part of that effort. For example, in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2022/07/01/covid-transportation-ridership-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Washington DC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, buses maintained and regained riders at a quicker rate than Metrorail, the extensive heavy rail network – another indication of their critical importance to improve equity.</span></p>
<p>But buses get stuck in traffic, causing severe delays that makes service unreliable and individual trips much longer. Average bus speeds across the United States reach <a href="https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/2018-APTA-Fact-Book.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">no more than 12 mph</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. In New York City, that average speed drops to </span><a href="https://www.amny.com/transit/mta-bus-speeds-slow-down-in-all-five-boroughs/"><span style="font-weight: 400">7.9 mph</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p>These slow speeds have negative consequences for ridership. According to research cited by <a href="https://transitcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TC_WhosOnBoard_Final_digital-1-1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">TransitCenter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the quality of service – not the advent of Uber and Lyft or decreasing gas prices – was the largest cause of declining transit ridership pre-COVID 19. Additionally, from that same report, those riders that did switch to transportation network companies (TNCs) cited slow speeds and unreliable service as reasons for leaving transit. </span></p>
<p>Slow and unreliable transit service has major consequences for social equity, perpetuating deep inequalities along race and class lines. Commute time is <a href="http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/images/nbhds_exec_summary.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">the number one predictor of economic mobility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and across the U.S., transit riders experience some of the longest commutes to work. Improving bus service is thus an important and effective way to improve equity.</span></p>
<p>One way transit agencies and cities can make public transit more equitable is by establishing and enforcing dedicated bus lanes, as recommended by the <a href="https://nacto.org/move-that-bus/"><span style="font-weight: 400">National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in its recent report, “</span><a href="https://www.hayden.ai/want-to-reduce-emissions-build-and-enforce-bus-lanes-nacto-finds"><span style="font-weight: 400">Move! That! Bus!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">” Dedicated road space for buses can significantly improve bus speeds, with recent research from </span><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2019/10/17/even-more-data-shows-that-citys-car-ban-on-14th-street-is-making-buses-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400">New York City’s 14th Street bus lane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> showing that just months after launching in 2019, travel times were 30% shorter. This resulted in a major ridership increase: 17% more riders on weekdays (</span><a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/select-bus-service-improvements-new-14th-street-busway-increase-m14-bus"><span style="font-weight: 400">increasing daily weekday ridership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to 31,000) and 37% more on Saturdays.</span></p>
<p>Yet as NACTO notes, bus lanes only work if there are no cars in them. Illegal parking and driving in bus lanes makes it difficult for transit agencies to provide reliable and on-time bus service. And illegal parking at bus stops can make it impossible for disabled riders to board or exit the bus, as parked vehicles block bus access to the curb. This too has major equity implications, as low-income communities have a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fresc.2022.877555/full#B28"><span style="font-weight: 400">higher percentage of disabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> than the general public.</span></p>
<p>Automated camera enforcement is a powerful and equitable solution to this problem. “During San Francisco’s pilot program, automated enforcement cameras reduced delays in dedicated bus lanes by 3-15%, and less than 2% of drivers received more than one ticket,” NACTO writes in its report. “Cameras are a more equitable, sustainable, and effective option than relying on a police officer to enforce dedicated bus lanes.”</p>
<p>At Hayden AI, we’re proud to strengthen public transit – and all who ride – by keeping bus lanes clear for buses through our automated bus lane enforcement platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/deadlydodge.png?w=400"></p><!-- FeaturedImageEnd --><p>Meet the new <em>electric</em> Dodge; same as the old <em>gasoline</em>-powered Dodge?</p>
<p>Like all automobile manufacturers, Dodge — maker of “muscle” cars including the Charger, Challenger and Durango — has had to adapt to the new reality of an American market that <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/08/18/the-death-of-the-muscle-car-as-we-know-it-isnt-necessarily-good-news/">is shifting from noisy, emission-belching, gasoline-powered vehicles</a> to quieter, less-polluting electric ones.</p>
<figure id="attachment_464954" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 220px" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-464954"><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tom-Flood.jpg"><img class="wp-image-464954 " sizes="(min-width: 80em) 683px,(min-width: 64em) and (max-width: 80em) 683px,(min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 64em) 683px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 64em) 683px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 48em) 683px,(max-width: 32em) 512px,(max-width: 48em) 683px,683px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tom-Flood.jpg?w=683&amp;h=889 683w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tom-Flood.jpg?w=512&amp;h=666 512w" alt="Tom Flood" width="220" height="287" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-464954" class="wp-caption-text">Tom Flood</figcaption></figure>
<p>The company, which markets its muscle cars as vehicles for <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/08/16/opinion-muscle-car-makers-market-mayhem/">speeding, drag racing, and mayhem</a> — in effect, as killing machines, which they have become on the streets of New York and other cities — <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/08/18/the-death-of-the-muscle-car-as-we-know-it-isnt-necessarily-good-news/">recently announced that it is retiring its gas-guzzling brood</a> and reintroducing the models as EVs. Even so, it has found a way to defeat the milquetoast image associated with electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Enter the 2024 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvayrMZoivg" rel="noopener">Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Banshee</a> (still a concept vehicle), which the company has been showcasing at auto shows with its usual pitch: a big, fat thumb in the eye of “authority.”</p>
<p>For Dodge, selling anti-establishment rebellion as a way to reach deep into America’s wallets is a cinch.</p>
<p>“We didn’t ask for the rules to change. We didn’t want them to change, but they did,” growled Dodge’s CEO Tim Kuniskis, introducing the Banshee at a drag-racing event in Detroit this summer. “And we can try to outrun them, but that would be a nine second pass straight into extinction. Or we can do what we did: read their rules. Study their rules. Find their gray areas, then ‘unleash the Banshee.’ Trust me, this is <em>not</em> the EV they want you to have. This is the way <em>Dodge</em> does EVs.”</p>
<p>As an adman who has worked on automotive accounts, <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/08/16/opinion-muscle-car-makers-market-mayhem/">I have called for the regulation</a> of the toxic ads that carmakers use to sell their products, which are just as noxious as cigarette advertising. But, given Dodge’s new strategy, it’s time for Americans to adopt another measure to curtail monstrous muscle cars like the Charger: <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/new-york-traffic-camera-exhaust-noise-muffler-ticket/">sound cameras — traffic cameras with mics</a>, which record decibel levels and ticket noisy vehicles. New York City already has <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/news/22-005/roadside-sound-meter-camera-is-activated-loud-mufflers-now-sending-notices-vehicle" rel="noopener">some of the devices</a>, which likely will spread around the country.</p>
<p>See, even though EVs are a smooth and quiet experience, Dodge has an ingenious work-around to get the vintage muscle-car sound that satisfies its caveman customer base. According to its promotional material, “This is the EV you didn’t see coming but you’ll hear coming,” thanks to Dodge’s patented “<a href="https://www.motorbiscuit.com/is-the-dodge-charger-evs-fratzonic-chambered-exhaust-system-just-a-speaker-making-engine-noises/">Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust</a>,” which outputs <a href="https://hearing.health.mil/Prevention/Causes-of-Injury/High-Decibel-Levels">sound up to 126 decibels</a>, right at the cusp of the human pain threshold! The company aims to make our streets a non-stop auto karaoke party that Americans can’t escape — simulating aggressive sound in a desperate attempt to retrofit archaic and unnecessary toxic attributes for their core market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.motorbiscuit.com/is-the-dodge-charger-evs-erupt-actually-a-manual-transmission/">Dodge’s new multi-speed transmission system, eRUPT,</a> simulates the thrill of the muscle car’s traditional rough ride, “throw[ing] your shoulders back into the seat at shift points.” This power-affirming physical motion, which buyers crave in order to validate their dominance on our streets, goes nicely with some other new “features” users can unlock, such as <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2022/08/production-dodge-charger-daytona-ev-to-offer-nine-outputs-unlockable-drift-and-drag-modes/">Slam Mode, Drift Mode, Drag Mode and, of course, the driving staple, Donut Mode</a> (which, as the names suggest, give the car more power and make it like a race car).</p>
<p>So what, you say? Dodge has trafficked in automotive violence and toxic masculinity for more than five decades; the Charger, in particular, gain fame through racist, violent TV shows and movies like “Dukes of Hazzard” and “The Fast and the Furious,” and has figured in deadly crashes, such as the Charlottesville vehicle-ramming attack that killed justice activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville_car_attack">Heather Heyer.</a></p>
<p>You might argue that you can’t fault a company for knowing its brand and customers. Well, as Streetsblog <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/crash-test-electric-cars-are-more-dangerous-than-conventional-cars-says-global-insurance-company/">recently reported</a>, EVs are heavier, with faster acceleration, and cause more damage in collisions. So, this real-world danger, mixed with Dodge’s notorious positioning of violent driving, catapults this retro-obsessed vehicle forward into a new electrified world of road violence — or, as Dodge puts it, “an assault and battery on convention.”</p>
<p>In this ever-changing landscape, a company that profits from a toxic heritage is now taking the worst from its past and present and “slamming” it into its and, unfortunately, our future. Let’s enact thoughtful measures that run these monstrous muscle cars off the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/redlight.png?w=400"></p><!-- FeaturedImageEnd --><p>The nation&#8217;s capital is poised to become the second major city in the United States to repeal a dangerous law that allowed drivers to make right turns at red lights — and some advocates believe other communities are overdue to follow.</p>
<p>In a preliminary vote last week, the Washington, D.C. council unanimously approved the <a href="https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Legislation/B24-0673">Safer Intersections Act</a>, which will prohibit right-on-reds except at designated intersections, as well as allow cyclists to treat stoplights as yield signs, since they&#8217;ll, ostensibly, no longer have to worry about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yVFmAilK9U">&#8220;right-hook&#8221; crashes</a> with drivers. <i>(Warning: footage depicted in the previous link may be disturbing.)</i> The proposal, which still must pass a final vote, would go into effect in 2025, contingent upon (because this is the District of Columbia) Congressional approval.</p>
<p>But if it passes, D.C. will join New York City as one of just two major metropolitan areas in the U.S. that have made the reform.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A pedestrian perspective of a driver attempting a right on red. Thank you DC Council for voting to ban this dangerous behavior! <a href="https://t.co/RcJU8l95CH">pic.twitter.com/RcJU8l95CH</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mark Sussman (@MarkSussman_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkSussman_/status/1574750384828325889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Street safety advocates hailed the news — and questioned why the dangerous maneuver was ever allowed at all.</p>
<p>Rights-on-red are currently illegal throughout much of Europe, and they were also banned throughout much of the U.S. prior to the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, whose authors argued that the U.S. could cut down on emissions and fuel usage by allowing them. Under the law, states still can&#8217;t receive federal funding from what is now known as the State Energy Program unless they allow drivers to turn against the stoplight — despite the fact that the program, which was once helped states create sweeping energy conservation plans, is now largely used to weatherize buildings and isn&#8217;t even administered by the Department of Transportation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s a small inconvenience for drivers with a big potential payoff. In DC, several people have been killed this summer when large trucks turned right on red and didn’t see cyclists coming in the bike lane. This would make streets safer for everybody.</p>
<p>&mdash; Kalisha Holmes (@Kalisha_Holmes) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kalisha_Holmes/status/1572439372708073472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Opponents of right-on-red laws, though, say that there are better ways to save on idling emissions today, including the advent of electric and other fuel-efficient cars, modern technologies like &#8220;Stop-Start&#8221; systems that automatically shut down and restart engines at red lights, and even just creating communities where it&#8217;s safe and convenient for residents not to drive at all.</p>
<p>Those strategies are all the more important considering the troubling safety trade-offs of right turns on reds. Though motorists are technically supposed to come to a complete stop and confirm that no one is in their path, advocates say many drivers don&#8217;t — either because they mistakenly believe they have the right of way, or because they physically cannot see a person in an immediately adjacent crosswalk from behind the windshield of an ultra-large vehicle.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/03/17/study-megacar-drivers-up-to-4x-more-likely-to-hit-walkers-while-turning/">recent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study</a> found that drivers of the massive SUVs that have saturated the American car market are three times more likely than a sedan driver to hit a pedestrian in their path while turning. Pick-up truck drivers, meanwhile, are <em>four </em>times more likely, thanks to those vehicles&#8217; high clearance from the ground and thick &#8220;A-pillars&#8221; on either side of the windshield, both of which create massive front and side blind zones.</p>
<p>Even before megacars became Americans&#8217; favorite way to get around, though, right-on-reds still weren&#8217;t safe for vulnerable road users. As far back as 1982, researchers had <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022437582900019#!">already found</a> that the law increased bicyclist crashes involving right-turning vehicles at signalized intersections as much as 82 percent in some states, while causing pedestrian crashes under those conditions to <em>more than double</em> in others.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Right on red &#8211; an exception, not a right of way &#8211; destroys the safety of the actual right of way for pedestrians <a href="https://t.co/U7LkCFWRjr">https://t.co/U7LkCFWRjr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Addison Del Mastro (@ad_mastro) <a href="https://twitter.com/ad_mastro/status/1574815239358619650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Repealing a nearly universal 40-year-old traffic law, though, is never easy — and it may not be in D.C., either.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the nation&#8217;s capital already banned rights-on-reds at certain intersections in 2018 and recorded safety improvements for pedestrians and cyclists, opponents of the proposed new law have claimed the council &#8220;<a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/investigations/right-turn-on-red-ban-dc-council/65-2fbbeab9-f7f6-4524-904d-a0dd360ebe78">lacks data</a>&#8221; to prove that <em>enough</em> residents were saved from death and serious injury to justify taking the reform district-wide. (The National Transportation Safety Administration made a similar argument in 1995, when it<a href="https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/outreach/traftech/1995/tt086.htm"> found</a> that less than 1 percent of fatal and injury crashes on U.S. roads involved a right on red — though 22 percent of those crashes involved a bicyclist or pedestrian, and that person was injured a staggering 93 percent of the time, to say nothing of the harrowing impact of near-miss crashes that aren&#8217;t recorded in federal stats and might scare travelers off of active transportation entirely.)</p>
<p>Others said the restriction causes traffic back-ups that could cost hourly employees a small fraction of their wages, even if it does save lives — an argument that was echoed in local debate over a <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2022/09/ann-arbors-proposed-ban-on-red-light-turns-downtown-raises-equity-concerns.html?utm_campaign=annarbornews_sf&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">similar proposed law in Ann Arbor, Mich.,</a> and was widely dismissed as outrageous.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Still others worried that the burden of steep fines for red-light turns would fall disproportionately on low-income drivers — even if the District&#8217;s almost entirely automated enforcement division would likely save them from direct contact with police officers that could lead to violence, particularly for people of color.</p>
<p>Proponents of the ban, though, point out that the council is pursuing <a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/09/19/under-new-bill-d-c-s-traffic-cameras-would-dole-out-points-as-well-as-fines/">separate legislation</a> to hold wealthy recidivist motorists accountable by assessing points on their licenses, too — and that traffic violence, which disproportionately effects D.C.&#8217;s Black communities, is an equity concern as well.</p>
<p>“I am very clear-eyed in recognizing that this is a controversial conversation that we are going to have,&#8221; said Council Member Christina Henderson in an interview with <a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/09/19/under-new-bill-d-c-s-traffic-cameras-would-dole-out-points-as-well-as-fines/">DCist</a> about the latter bill. &#8220;I am also very clear in knowing that when we talk about traffic violence, the vast majority of incidents are occurring in communities of color. And so we have to talk about this in a way that deals with that tension.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Whatever the fate of DC&#8217;s right-on-red bill, advocates in other cities are already getting inspired to pursue similar moves in their own communities — and if the Safer Intersections Act passes, it could serve as a template for their efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much that&#8217;s complicated about right turn on red: you ban it, or it&#8217;s legal,&#8221; said Alex Baca, DC policy director for Greater Greater Washington. &#8220;To the extent that other jurisdictions are looking for model legislation, they could gank text from this; to the extent that they are looking for an excuse to do it because someone else has done it and therefore doing so doesn&#8217;t seem like so much of a liability &#8230;they can [possibly do that too].&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Car-Crash-Ambulance-e1645201457828.png?w=504"></p><!-- FeaturedImageEnd --><p>Downtown rush hour has still not roared back to pre-pandemic levels even as car travel surges in the suburbs, a new study finds — and it may help explain why traffic deaths have stayed so stubbornly high in U.S. communities.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://learn.streetlightdata.com/hubfs/eBooks%20and%20Research/Congestion%20Report/Downtown%20Congestion%20Report.pdf">the transportation analytics firm Streetlight</a>, the number of motorists driving through America&#8217;s 10 largest city cores in April 2022 was down a whopping 27 percent compared to the same month in 2019 — with some particularly car-dependent areas, like downtown Phoenix, experiencing as much as a 32-percent decline.</p>
<p>And those drops weren&#8217;t distributed evenly throughout the day, either. During what used to be the peak morning rush hour, average &#8220;vehicle hours of delay&#8221; were down a staggering 40 percent compared to before the pandemic. At midday, they were down just 22 percent — and given <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/whats-going-to-happen-to-all-those-empty-office-buildings/">high rates of vacancy</a> in downtown office buildings, the researchers theorize that the rise of remote work is why.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, these areas have depended a lot on the daily office population, even in supposed 24-hour cities like New York and San Francisco,&#8221; said Martin Morzynski, a spokesperson for the company. &#8220;Even now, there are hundreds of thousands of people missing from American downtowns — and they&#8217;re predominantly white-collar workers who used to work in offices and now work from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first, fewer drivers in places where people are most likely to walk might seem like a win for traffic safety. But as countless American communities learned all too well during the Covid-19 quarantines, an absence of traffic jams <em>without </em>accompanying infrastructure changes to slow down the drivers who remain can transform whole communities into wide-open raceways — and send road deaths skyrocketing, particularly among vulnerable road users.</p>
<p>Pedestrian deaths spiked <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mind-boggling-pedestrian-deaths-surged-2020-despite-fewer-cars-road-n1267910">21 percent</a> between 2019 and 2020, despite — or, more accurately, <i>because </i>— of the near-total absence of congestion as U.S. residents sheltered in place.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">Experts have struggled, though, to explain why deaths</span><em style="font-size: 16px"> kept</em><span style="font-size: 16px"> going up in 2021, even as national vehicle miles traveled climbed closer towards pre-pandemic averages. Streetlight&#8217;s data may lend credence to one popular theory: that now-remote workers are spreading their mileage more evenly throughout the day </span><i style="font-size: 16px">and </i><span style="font-size: 16px">across a wider variety of non-downtown roadways, enabling them to avoid traffic jams and maintain deadly speeds almost everywhere they go. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_229334" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229334" style="width: 365px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Traffic-volumes.png"><img class="wp-image-229334" sizes="(min-width: 80em) 1272px,(min-width: 64em) and (max-width: 80em) 1272px,(min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 64em) 1024px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 64em) 1024px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 48em) 768px,(max-width: 32em) 512px,(max-width: 48em) 768px,1272px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Traffic-volumes.png?w=1272&amp;h=1536 1272w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Traffic-volumes.png?w=1024&amp;h=1237 1024w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Traffic-volumes.png?w=768&amp;h=927 768w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Traffic-volumes.png?w=512&amp;h=618 512w" alt="Graphic: Streetlight Data" width="365" height="441" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-229334" class="wp-caption-text">Vehicle Hours of Delay in 10 US Cities.

<p>&#8220;A lot of these workers are driving as much as ever, but they&#8217;re not always commuting downtown anymore,&#8221; Morzynski adds. &#8220;They may be getting out and driving to coffee in their suburban neighborhood than walking to the coffeeshop down the street from their office; they might be picking up the kid from school rather than having them take the bus; they’re running a midday errand that they otherwise would have bundled with another trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morzynski is careful to note that changing traffic patterns probably can&#8217;t explain all of the pandemic&#8217;s traffic death trends, and that reckless driving, dangerous vehicle design, and people walking more on pedestrian-hostile roads are probably playing a role, too. Still, he says the safety impacts of the shift deserve further study — not just in city centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do data to back up that, despite traffic being down on average in the urban core, there are certain roads — highways and highway-feeders in the suburbs— where there are a lot more cars than there were before,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;What that means for safety is that, if you’re a cyclist on one of those roads, well, things might be a little more dangerous and dicey than they were before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than attempting to woo automobile commuters back downtown, the Streetlight researchers say the pandemic has offered officials &#8220;a chance to return many public spaces to pedestrians and cyclists&#8221; and allow city cores to go back &#8220;to their roots as mixed-use communities with denser urban amenities like restaurants, cultural venues, schools, and other services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morzynski adds that some local governments got a taste of that when they piloted open streets events and other initiatives during quarantine — and he&#8217;s hopeful that many are contemplating more permanent change.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re hearing a lot more from cities since the pandemic feels like a culture shift,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[Leaders are saying], &#8216;While we care about congestion, we care more about safety — and if we have to slow down cars to make people safer, that’s okay.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/Sidewalk-robot.jpg?w=524"></p><!-- FeaturedImageEnd --><p>Whether contending with broken pavement or speeding drivers, sidewalk delivery robots struggle to get around U.S. cities for many of the same reasons as human pedestrians, a new study finds — but that&#8217;s not the only reason why the emerging technology might struggle to deliver on its car-cutting promises without careful planning.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Oregon&#8217;s Urbanism Next Center and the consultancy group CityFi <a href="https://www.urbanismnext.org/resources/piloting-sidewalk-delivery-robots-in-pittsburg-miami-dade-county-detroit-and-san-jose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with</a> the Knight Foundation to bring a small fleet of &#8220;pedestrian delivery devices,&#8221; or PDDs, to the sidewalks of four U.S. cities and explore whether they could be used to meet local goals — without subtracting even more of the scarce right-of-way that cities grant to humans who walk and roll.</p>
<figure id="attachment_229215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229215" style="width: 214px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-4.30.02-PM.png"><img class="wp-image-229215 " sizes="(min-width: 80em) 660px,(min-width: 64em) and (max-width: 80em) 660px,(min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 64em) 660px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 64em) 660px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 48em) 660px,(max-width: 32em) 512px,(max-width: 48em) 660px,660px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-4.30.02-PM.png?w=660&amp;h=860 660w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-4.30.02-PM.png?w=512&amp;h=667 512w" alt="A Kiwibot in San Jose, Calif.

<p>The communities in the pilot — Detroit, Pittsburgh, San José and Miami-Dade County — all had a long history of welcoming the autonomous vehicle industry onto their roads, but less experience with the kind of robo-vehicles specifically designed to share the footpath with people.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s in part because sidewalk delivery robots are still relatively rare in the U.S., and the few that are out there are the subject of hot debate. Proponents of PDDs say that many short delivery trips currently performed by dangerous, polluting trucks could theoretically be done by slow, suitcase-sized &#8216;bots instead, even as cities like Toronto have <a href="https://thespoon.tech/some-cities-are-pushing-back-on-sidewalk-robots-here-are-some-possible-solutions-for-peaceful-coexistence/">balked</a> at the idea of undermining their residents&#8217; already-threatened access to car-free road space.</p>
<p>The researchers behind the study, though, emphasize that the pilot was explicitly <em>not</em> designed to sell anyone on the controversial technology, but to see <em>if</em> PDDs could benefit some neighborhoods — and if so, how to roll them out right.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Knight Foundation&#8217;s goal was definitely not to see these things deployed on our streets,&#8221; said Nico Larco, director of the Urbanism Next Center and co-author of the report. &#8220;The question was, &#8216;If PDDs are deployed, how do we do so in a way that helps achieve community goals? &#8230; How can we make sure that we have equitable deployment of these vehicles, while, at the same time, not simply proliferating the problems that already exist in our transportation system?'&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iyO9TJHEQ7E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>To answer those questions, delivery startup Kiwibot — known mostly for making deliveries on college campuses using AVs capped at four miles per hour — deployed a small fleet of semi-autonomous PDDs to perform thousands of both simulated and actual robo-deliveries of food and consumer goods within the devices&#8217; 1.5-mile delivery radius. Over the six-month pilot, researchers engaged thousands of passersby, business owners, and other stakeholders about what they thought of the bots — and studied how well the bots did at navigating a car-dominated landscape.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly, the pedestrian delivery devices encountered many of the same challenges to getting around safely as their human counterparts — particularly those who rely on wheelchairs and other assistive devices to get around.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">In Pittsburgh, the Kiwibots found themselves unable to operate in a key neighborhood &#8220;due to infrastructure limitations such as cracked sidewalks &#8230; sidewalk obstructions such as overgrown trees or bushes, or if cars were parked blocking the [way].&#8221; Detroit&#8217;s PDDs, meanwhile, struggled to cross a particularly wide road on their route with a too-short walk signal </span>and an <span style="font-size: medium">inaccessible median, and some of San Jose&#8217;s bots got stuck or tipped over when confronted with sidewalk obstructions, rendering themselves inoperable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">On several occasions, the Kiwibots were even hit by drivers — an experience that, unfortunately, they share with<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/24/we-are-devastated-family-of-slain-sunset-park-delivery-worker-demands-justice/"> far too many</a> flesh-and-blood delivery people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">&#8220;For these robots to work, the city has to be walkable,&#8221; said Larco. &#8220;A lot of these cities have sidewalks that are too narrow, or there&#8217;s no ADA ramp on one side —or even both sides — of the street. That doesn&#8217;t work for people, either.</span><span style="font-size: medium">&#8220;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_229263" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229263" style="width: 2628px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/kiwibot-in-Detroit-street.png"><img class="wp-image-229263 size-full" sizes="(min-width: 80em) 1280px,(min-width: 64em) and (max-width: 80em) 1280px,(min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 64em) 1024px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 64em) 1024px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 48em) 768px,(max-width: 32em) 512px,(max-width: 48em) 768px,2628px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/kiwibot-in-Detroit-street.png?w=1280&amp;h=713 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/kiwibot-in-Detroit-street.png?w=1024&amp;h=570 1024w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/kiwibot-in-Detroit-street.png?w=768&amp;h=428 768w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/kiwibot-in-Detroit-street.png?w=512&amp;h=285 512w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/kiwibot-in-Detroit-street.png?w=2628&amp;h=1464 2628w" alt="From the report." width="2628" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-229263" class="wp-caption-text">From the report.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: medium">In some cases, the Kiwibots were able to map where walking conditions </span>were<span style="font-size: medium"> wanting and share that data with the researchers — though Larco points out that whether cities will actually have the money to<em> fix</em> problems that bots might spot is a separate question. And in some cases, humans actually had to help the <em>robots </em>get around, such as righting them </span><span style="font-size: medium">when they tripped on a piece of broken pavement. </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, none of the pilot participants reported any significant conflicts between pedestrians and PDDs, though Larco speculates that may be because there were fewer than 10 bots in each city, and some of their common routes have very few people walking around. In an urban metropolis where sidewalk space is a scarce and precious resource, Larco acknowledges that the conversation might be very different.</p>
<div>
<p>&#8220;In the pilots, there weren’t any incidents of real challenges between pedestrians and robots; there was more curiosity than anything,&#8221; he added. &#8220;But you can imagine that if pilot this was to tremendously scale up, or to be deployed in a denser urban areas, we might have different challenges&#8230;We&#8217;d have to find out; how much engagement would there be with the robots? Would people have an aversion to them? Would they trust them? Would they decide to play with them? Or would they derail them? &#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_229216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229216" style="width: 303px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Sidewalk-robot-stuck.png"><img class="wp-image-229216 " sizes="(min-width: 80em) 936px,(min-width: 64em) and (max-width: 80em) 936px,(min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 64em) 936px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 64em) 936px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 48em) 768px,(max-width: 32em) 512px,(max-width: 48em) 768px,936px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Sidewalk-robot-stuck.png?w=936&amp;h=762 936w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Sidewalk-robot-stuck.png?w=768&amp;h=625 768w,https://i0.wp.com/usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Sidewalk-robot-stuck.png?w=512&amp;h=417 512w" alt="Photo: Urbanism Next" width="303" height="247" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-229216" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: <a href="https://www.urbanismnext.org/resources/piloting-sidewalk-delivery-robots-in-pittsburg-miami-dade-county-detroit-and-san-jose">Urbanism Next</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Larco adds, though, that dangerous or crowded built environments aren&#8217;t the only barriers that delivery bots might face on the road to widespread adoption. The researchers initially hoped to use the bots to help small businesses establish a low-cost delivery service — a particularly urgent concern during the first year of the pandemic, when the pilot took place — but found that some struggled to integrate the technology into their workflow because they didn&#8217;t even have websites, much less an ordering platform that could integrate seamlessly with cutting-edge tech.</p>
<p>All those struggles, Larco warns, could have real consequences for city residents who might come to rely on PDDs. Though delivery bots have been put forward as a great way to, for instance, bring a can of baby formula to the doorstep of an exhausted new parent in the middle of the night, the stakes of that package <em>not </em>showing up may be too high to entrust to a robot that could be sidelined by a software glitch or a car parked on the sidewalk. The researchers warn that PDDS are &#8220;<span style="font-size: 16px">not ready to fulfill essential community needs,&#8221; and that even small pilots should focus on less-critical deliveries, like take-out food.  </span></p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;If anything, what these pilots brought out is that there are a whole range of issues that need to be addressed — and not just about infrastructure,&#8221; said Larco. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 16px">Sometimes, vulnerable populations are not the best groups to be testing this stuff with, especially if they’re folks who have limited capacity to take on risk. If I’m a wealthy person in a wealthy neighborhood and I try to get my PDD delivery of my medicine and it doesn’t work, I’m a little frustrated, but I get my car and go get it. If I’m an older person who’s relying on this, and it doesn’t work, that’s a real problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Still, Larco is optimistic that pedestrian delivery devices may be able to help serve community goals someday — or at least, that<em> piloting</em> the tech won&#8217;t cause harm, with careful planning.</p>
<div>
<p>&#8220;We need more and more of these pilots where private and public sector are figuring out together what the benefits to communities might be, and how cities can help in facilitatintg deployment,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of good-hearted interest in using emerging technology to help solve community problems, but we need to get it right.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Replacing petroleum fuels with electricity is crucial for curbing climate change because it cuts carbon dioxide emissions from transportation – the largest source of U.S. global warming emissions and a growing source worldwide. Even including the impacts of generating electricity to run them, electric vehicles <a href="http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1257/pol.20190390">provide clear environmental benefits</a>.</p>
<p>Plug-in vehicles are making great progress, with their <a href="https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates">share of U.S. car and light truck sales </a> jumping from 2% to 4% in 2020-2021 and projected to exceed 6% by the end of 2022. But sales of gas-guzzling pickups and SUVs <a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/light-trucks-now-outselling-cars/">are also surging</a>. This other face of the market subverts electric cars’ carbon-cutting progress.</p>
<p>As a researcher who studies <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wQ5IYG4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">transportation and climate change</a>, it’s clear to me that EVs provide large carbon reductions that will grow as the electric grid shifts to carbon-free energy. But fleetwide emissions, including vehicles of all types and ages, are what ultimately matters for the climate.</p>
<p>While the latest policy advances will speed the transition to EVs, actual <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-00921-7">emission reductions could be hastened</a> by tightening greenhouse gas emissions standards, especially for the larger gasoline-powered personal trucks that dominate transportation’s carbon footprint. Because <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf4d2">it takes 20 years to largely replace the on-road automobile fleet</a>, gas vehicles bought today will still be driving and emitting carbon dioxide in 2040 and beyond.</p>

<h2>Public policy progress</h2>
<p>Plugging in rather than pumping gas <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/reducing-pollution-electric-vehicles">reduces both global warming and smog-forming pollution</a>. It avoids the ecological harm of petroleum production and reduces the economic and security risks of a world oil market coupled to totalitarian regimes such as those of Russia and in the Middle East.</p>
<p>On the good news front, automakers are offering ever more EV choices and promising all-electric fleets within 15 years or so. Two recent policy developments will help turn such promises into reality.</p>
<p>One is California’s recent <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/news/california-moves-accelerate-100-new-zero-emission-vehicle-sales-2035">update to its zero-emission vehicle program</a>. The new regulations will require that by 2035, 100% of new light vehicles sold in California must be qualifying zero-emission vehicles, allowing for a limited number of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Other states that historically have adopted California’s emission standards may follow its lead, so cars running only on gasoline could ultimately be banned across 40% of the U.S. new car market.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/12/inflation-reduction-act-house-vote/">Inflation Reduction Act</a> recently signed by President Biden includes new incentives for EVs and subsidies for domestic production of EVs, batteries and critical minerals. The new policy <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/electric-vehicle-tax-credits-6500157">targets incentives in several ways</a>, disqualifying high-income consumers, capping the price of qualifying vehicles, providing incentives for used EVs, and restricting the tax credits to EVs built in the U.S. and Canada. It complements the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/14/fact-sheet-president-bidens-economic-plan-drives-americas-electric-vehicle-manufacturing-boom/">US$7.5 billion for building a national EV charging network</a> authorized by the infrastructure bill that the Biden administration brokered in 2021.</p>

<h2>The consumption conundrum</h2>
<p>In spite of rapidly growing sales, however, EVs have not yet measurably cut carbon. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data indicates that the rate of carbon dioxide reduction from new vehicles has <a href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends">all but stalled, while vehicle mass and power have reached all-time highs</a>.</p>
<p>Why? The surging popularity of low-fuel-economy pickups and SUVs. My analysis of the EPA data shows that through 2021, the higher emissions from market shifts to larger, more powerful vehicles swamp the potential carbon dioxide reductions from EVs <a href="https://www.carsclimate.com/2022/09/truck-vs-EV-CO2-gap-thru-2021.html">by more than a factor of three</a>.</p>
<p>Including the largest personal pickup trucks, which are omitted from the EPA’s public data, would further increase the gasoline vehicle emissions that overwhelm EV carbon reductions. Because vehicles <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/809952">remain on the road for so long</a>, excessive emissions from popular but under-regulated pickups and SUVs will harm the climate for many years.</p>
<h2>Complications of clean-car rules</h2>
<p>A reason for this conundrum is that <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/regulations-greenhouse-gas-emissions-passenger-cars-and">clean-car standards</a> are averaged across the overall fleets of cars and light trucks that automakers sell. When a manufacturer increases its sales of EVs and other high-efficiency vehicles, it can sell a greater number of less fuel-efficient vehicles while still meeting regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The standards are structured in several ways that further weaken their effectiveness. The targets an automaker has to meet <a href="https://www.autonews.com/article/20160814/OEM11/308159946/is-cafe-making-cars-bigger">get weaker if it makes its vehicles larger</a>. Vehicles classified as light trucks – including four-wheel-drive and large SUVs, as well as vans and pickups – are held to weaker standards than those classified as cars.</p>
<p>What’s worse, a regulatory loophole allows the largest pickups to effectively evade meaningful carbon constraints. Such vehicles are classified as “work trucks” even though they are sold and priced as luxury personal vehicles. An ongoing horsepower war gives these massive “<a href="https://twitter.com/uhalevi/status/1333077860119171072">suburban cowboy</a>” trucks capabilities far beyond those of the relatively spartan pickups once used by cost-conscious businesses.</p>
<h2>Toward faster emission reductions</h2>
<p>In spite of falling prices and rising sales, electric cars <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/contributors/2019/01/11/electric-cars-evs/2535200002/">still face hurdles</a> before they can fully sweep the market. <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/shopping-advice/a32600212/ev-charging-time/">The time it takes to charge an electric car</a> may remain an inconvenience for many consumers. For example, commonly available Level 2 chargers take <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/ev/toolkit/ev-basics/charging-speeds">four to 10 hours</a> to fully recharge an EV battery.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ft-aMNRDXD8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Such obstacles make it <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35118090/are-we-ready-for-the-zero-emission-future/">unclear whether the car market can move as quickly</a> to an all-electric future as some hope.</p>
<p>Emissions could be cut more quickly if regulators reform clean car standards to close the loopholes that allow excess emissions. California is taking a step in this direction by revising its methods for determining new fleet emission limits for gasoline vehicles. Also hopeful is the recent <a href="https://www.edf.org/media/gm-and-edf-announce-recommended-principles-epa-emissions-standards-model-year-2027-and-beyond">joint announcement by General Motors and the Environmental Defense Fund</a>, which notes the need to address the large light trucks as part of new standards targeting a 60% reduction in fleetwide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p>
<p>As the world transitions to EVs, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/electric-vehicles/">their size and energy use will matter</a>, too. Massive EVs will require large batteries, and hence more <a href="https://theconversation.com/making-evs-without-chinas-supply-chain-is-hard-but-not-impossible-3-supply-chain-experts-outline-a-strategy-189453">critical minerals whose supplies are limited</a>. They will demand more electricity that, even if renewable, is <a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/impacts-renewable-energy-facilities">not fully free of environmental impacts</a>. Sustainability will suffer if the roads are ruled more by the likes of <a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev">Hummer EVs</a> rather than <a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3">Tesla Model 3s</a>.</p>
<p>Policymakers and environmental organizations have mounted major promotional campaigns in support of EVs. But there are no similar efforts to encourage consumers to <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20180521/MOBILITY/180529995/1137">choose the most efficient vehicle</a> that meets their needs. Significant numbers of Americans <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-november-2019/toc/2/">now believe that global warming is for real and of concern</a>. Connecting such beliefs to everyday vehicle purchases is a missing link in clean-car strategy.</p>
<p>These sobering car market trends highlight the risk of letting visions of an all-electric future mask the need for better decisions today – by policymakers, consumers and automakers – to more quickly reduce emissions across the entire vehicle fleet.</p>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>South Korean military officials have reported that Chinese planes violated Seoul’s air defense zone dozens of times last year</strong></p> <p>Chinese aircraft intruded on South Korea&rsquo;s air defense zone without warning more than 70 times last year, military officials in Seoul have reportedly claimed.</p> <p>The pace of Chinese violations of the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) was about the same as in 2020, <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20221003002400325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yonhap News</a> reported on Monday, citing a document that the South Korean defense ministry submitted to the National Assembly. There were over 20 such violations by Russia in 2019, the media outlet claimed, without providing more recent figures.</p> <p>The KADIZ was first drawn up by the US Air Force in 1951, during the Korean War. The zone extends beyond South Korea&rsquo;s territorial air space, but Seoul requires pilots of foreign aircraft to identify themselves to prevent unintentional confrontations. For instance, Japanese planes enter the KADIZ about 500 times annually after giving notice to South Korean authorities.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>While most intrusions pass without brouhaha, South Korea scrambles military jets in some cases to respond. For example, at least four Chinese and four Russian warplanes breached the KADIZ several times on May 24, prompting Seoul to send up fighter jets in response.</p> <p>That incident occurred as US President Joe Biden was wrapping up his visit to the region. Russia and China held a joint military exercise that included flights by strategic bombers over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea while Biden was in Japan. The South Korean military also scrambled fighter jets when Russian aircraft entered the KADIZ without warning in August.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Dmitry Medvedev joked the American was a secret Russian agent who blew his cover</strong></p> <p>After Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and Kiev&rsquo;s online troll army savaged Elon Musk&rsquo;s proposal for ending the conflict with Russia, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev jokingly called the Tesla and SpaceX founder a <em>&ldquo;shadowy agent&rdquo;</em> of the Kremlin, comparing him to Stierlitz, the legendary fictional Soviet spy.</p> <p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Kudos to [Elon Musk]! However, the shadowy agent has lost the cover. Deserves a new rank, fast. His next tweet will run like, Ukraine is an artificial state. Anticipating&hellip;&rdquo;</em> Medvedev <a href="https://twitter.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1577032704327286784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, in English, on Monday evening.</p> <p><strong></strong>On his Telegram channel, in Russian, instead of <em>&ldquo;shadowy agent&rdquo;</em> the former president <a href="https://t.me/medvedev_telegram/186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> Musk <em>&ldquo;Eustace&rdquo;</em> &ndash; a reference to the code name of the main character in the Soviet-era series &lsquo;17 Moments of Spring,&rsquo; better known under his German alias Otto von Stierlitz.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong></strong>Both references were clearly tongue-in-cheek and poked fun not at Musk, but at the utter hysterics of the Ukrainian government and its online influencers over the American billionaire&rsquo;s earnest peace proposal.</p> <p><strong></strong>Crimea would remain Russian and have its water supply guaranteed, Ukraine would declare neutrality, and the four regions that just joined Russia hold UN-supervised referendums on their fate, Musk suggested earlier in the day. The poll was quickly swamped by what he called the <em>&ldquo;biggest bot attack I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><strong></strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/563999-ukraine-elon-musk-poll/"></a></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>It wasn&rsquo;t just Kiev&rsquo;s info-warriors and their Western NAFO backers, however. Ukraine&rsquo;s departing ambassador to Germany used some very un-diplomatic language, while President Vladimir Zelensky himself <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/564001-zelensky-elon-musk-poll/">launched a poll</a> asking his followers if they preferred Musk who supported Ukraine over this one, who <em>&ldquo;supports Russia.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><strong></strong>Early on in the conflict, Musk sent hundreds of SpaceX&rsquo;s Starlink satellites and terminals to Ukraine. Though their stated purpose was humanitarian, Kiev has since admitted to using them for the war effort.</p> <p><strong></strong>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev&rsquo;s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and <em>&ldquo;create powerful armed forces.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><strong></strong>Moscow also demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev has rejected this, insisting that the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Bloomberg hosts scrambled to stop Jeffrey Sachs as he laid blame for the pipeline explosion</strong></p> <p>Economist Jeffrey Sachs speculated on Monday that the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines was the work of the US and maybe Poland, to the chagrin of Bloomberg TV hosts who quickly tried to change the subject. Now a professor at Columbia University, Sachs became notorious in Russia for masterminding the <em>&ldquo;shock therapy&rdquo;</em> reforms in the 1990s &ndash; but has been sharply critical of the West&rsquo;s approach to the conflict in Ukraine in recent months.</p> <p><strong></strong>Invited to Bloomberg&rsquo;s &lsquo;Surveillance&rsquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/nbt-CsSRJl8?t=6696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show</a> on Monday, Sachs was asked to comment on Russia he <em>&ldquo;knew so well&rdquo;</em> under President Boris Yeltsin. Instead, the hosts scrambled to cut him off after he said the conflict is <em>&ldquo;on the path of escalation to nuclear war&rdquo;</em> and did not start in February 2022.</p> <p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Most of the world doesn&rsquo;t see it the way we describe it,&rdquo;</em> Sachs told Bloomberg&rsquo;s Tom Keene, at which point co-host Lisa Abramowicz tried to change the subject to inflation in Europe.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Columbia Univ.&#39;s Jeffrey Sachs: &quot;The destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline, which I would bet is a U.S.-Poland action [because] first of all, there is direct radar evidence that U.S. military helicopters that are normally based in Gdansk were circling over the area ...&quot; <a href="https://t.co/rGZ6VhlvPq">pic.twitter.com/rGZ6VhlvPq</a></p>&mdash; Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1577023521406210048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>The EU is in a <em>&ldquo;very sharp economic downturn,&rdquo;</em> Sachs agreed. The continent was <em>&ldquo;getting hammered&rdquo;</em> by energy shortages, made worse by <em>&ldquo;the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline which I would bet was a US action &ndash; perhaps US and Poland,&rdquo;</em> he managed to add before Keene cut him off, asking for evidence of that claim.</p> <p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Well first of all, there&rsquo;s direct radar evidence that US helicopters, military helicopters that are normally based in Gdansk, were circling over this area. We also had the threats from the US, earlier in this year, that &lsquo;one way or the other, we are going to end Nord Stream.&rsquo; We also have the remarkable statement by [US] Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/563861-blinken-nord-stream-opportunity/">last Friday</a> in a press conference; he says &lsquo;this is also a tremendous opportunity.&rsquo; Sorry, it&rsquo;s a strange way to talk if you&rsquo;re worried about piracy on international infrastructure of vital significance,&rdquo;</em> Sachs retorted.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><em>&ldquo;I know this runs counter to our narrative, you&rsquo;re not allowed to say these things in the West, but the fact of the matter is &ndash; all over the world, when I talk to people, they think the US did it,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p> <p>Abramowicz again tried to change the subject, saying Bloomberg couldn&rsquo;t provide <em>&ldquo;counterbalance&rdquo;</em> to what he was saying. Undeterred, Sachs answered the next question by describing the current situation as <em>&ldquo;the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis&rdquo;</em> in 1962, with the US picking fights with both Russia and China, without any attempts to de-escalate things.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong></strong>Currently director of the Center for Sustainable Development at New York&rsquo;s Columbia University, Sachs gained notoriety among the Russians for his <em>&ldquo;shock therapy&rdquo;</em> reforms in 1991-1993. The overhaul of the entire Soviet economy ended up destroying the lives of millions of Russians and handing the country&rsquo;s wealth over to a handful of oligarchs.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Republicans and Democrats alike believe their political rivals are winning on the issues that matter</strong></p> <p>Nearly three quarters of Americans &ndash; 72% &ndash; believe their political side is losing more often than it is winning on the issues that are important to them, according to a Pew Research poll published on Monday. Less than a quarter &ndash; 24% &ndash; think their camp is prevailing more often than not.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of the two &lsquo;sides,&rsquo; the Right has lost the most confidence in its political heft &ndash; 81% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they feel their side loses more often than it wins, compared to just 29% who held that view in February 2020, when former President Donald Trump was still in office.</p> <p>But while Republicans can blame their pessimism on the loss of the presidency and nearly the Senate during the last election, the reason for the Democrats&rsquo; malaise &ndash; fully two thirds (66%) of party voters and Democrat-leaning independents believe their side is defeated more often than it wins &ndash; is less obvious. However, exit polls in 2020 showed most Biden backers voted against then-President Donald Trump rather than for Biden, perhaps making them less invested in his victory.

  <![CDATA[ <p>Moderate Democrats were the most likely of all groups polled to believe they were winning, with 34% taking that view compared to 29% for liberals, 21% for moderate Republicans, and a mere 15% for those further to the right.&nbsp;</p> <p>The same poll, which was conducted once under President Barack Obama, three times under Trump, and twice now under Biden, reveals that overall more Americans felt like their side was winning in February 2020 (41%) than at any other time in the past six years. Monday&rsquo;s poll represented the most pessimistic moment during that period.</p> <p>Another recent poll revealed just how unenthusiastic both Republicans and Democrats are about their parties&rsquo; potential nominees for the 2024 presidential election &ndash; Trump and Biden, respectively. More than two-thirds of voters wanted to see Biden retire, while over half felt the same about Trump, though their reasons varied depending on their political affiliation and other factors. A hypothetical matchup between the unpopular septuagenarians would see Trump narrowly edge out Biden, but pollster Mark Penn, who conducted last month&rsquo;s survey, suggested there would be a &ldquo;<em>virtual voter revolt</em>&rdquo; in the event of a 2020 rematch.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The Ukrainian president rallied his followers against “the Elon Musk who supports Russia.”</strong></p> <p>Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky responded on Monday to a peace plan put forward by&nbsp;Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, which called on Ukraine to make some concessions to Russia.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a poll on Twitter, Zelensky asked his followers <em>&ldquo;which Elon Musk&rdquo;</em> they <em>&ldquo;like more&rdquo;</em>: the one <em>&ldquo;who supports Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> or the one<em> &ldquo;who supports Russia.&rdquo;</em> At time of writing, just under 85% chose the former.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Which <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> do you like more?</p>&mdash; Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1577006943499350016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Earlier on Monday, Musk suggested that Russia hold new UN-supervised referendums in its newly-acquired territories, while Ukraine formally relinquishes its claim to Crimea, guarantees the peninsula&rsquo;s water supply, and declares itself a neutral country.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end,&rdquo;</em> Musk continued, adding that it is <em>&ldquo;just a question of how many people die before then.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Musk put the plan to a poll, where around 60% of respondents approved before the vote swung against him. Musk attributed this rapid change in results to the <em>&ldquo;biggest bot attack I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Amid criticism from pro-Ukrainian posters and officials in Kiev, Musk stood firm, arguing that Russia&rsquo;s population advantage guarantees it victory should Zelensky follow through on his stated goal of retaking Crimea and Moscow declare war in response.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russia is doing partial mobilization.

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Billy Eichner, the star and co-writer of ‘Bros,’ has claimed that audiences stayed away because of the movie’s LGBTQ content</strong></p> <p>Hollywood actor Billy Eichner has suggested that his new movie, <em>&lsquo;Bros,&rsquo;</em> is a victim of anti-LGBTQ bigotry, saying the film fared poorly at the box office because heterosexual people objected to seeing a romantic comedy with gay characters.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Straight people, especially in certain parts of the country, just didn&rsquo;t show up for &lsquo;Bros,&rsquo;&rdquo;</em> Eichner said on Sunday in a Twitter post. <em>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s disappointing, but it is what it is.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Eichner, who co-wrote the movie and starred in it, argued that <em>&lsquo;Bros&rsquo;</em> had been praised by <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bros_2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">critics</a>. He alleged that an unidentified theater chain threatened to stop showing an advertisement for the film because of its gay content. <em>&ldquo;Everyone who isn&rsquo;t a homophobic weirdo should go see &lsquo;Bros&rsquo; tonight.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>The movie debuted on Friday and reportedly grossed $4.8 million at the box office, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/bros-billy-eichner-homophobics-box-office-1235231561/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">falling short</a> of an $8-10 million target set by Universal Pictures. The studio spent an estimated $22 million to make the film and $30 million so far on advertising and promotion.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Everyone who ISN’T a homophobic weirdo should go see BROS tonight!

Musk himself <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1576979962938081295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the poll was subjected to the <em>&ldquo;biggest bot attack I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The US or UK likely sabotaged the pipelines to block Germany from quitting the Ukraine crisis, an ex-colonel has claimed</strong></p> <p>Washington and London are the most likely culprits behind last week&rsquo;s attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, former Pentagon advisor and retired US Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor has claimed. He said the sabotage ploy would help ensure that Germany can&rsquo;t back away from arming Ukrainian forces against Russia.</p> <p>Speaking in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZSfz4N9GMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with podcast host Andrew Napolitano, Macgregor dismissed suggestions that Russia was responsible for the explosions that sprung leaks in the Nord Stream conduits, which carry natural gas across the Baltic Sea to Germany. <em>&ldquo;The Russians did not do this,&rdquo;</em> he said, noting that Russia&rsquo;s economy is heavily dependent on energy exports. <em>&ldquo;The notion that they did, I think, is absurd.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Macgregor, a special advisor to the secretary of defense under then-President Donald Trump, pointed out that explosives equivalent to thousands of pounds of TNT had to have been used to breach the pipelines. <em>&ldquo;You have several inches of concrete around various metal alloys to move the natural gas, so it&rsquo;s not something that you could simply drop a grenade down at the end of a fish line and disrupt.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Considering the level of sophistication required to pull off such an attack, Macgregor said, <em>&ldquo;You have to look at who are the state actors that have the capability to do this, and that means the Royal Navy, the United States Navy, special operations.&rdquo;</em> He noted that former Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski reacted to the Nord Stream attacks by saying, <em><a href="https://twitter.com/Royston1983/status/1575198400198324224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;Thank you, USA.&rdquo;</a></em></p> <p>The pipeline blasts came at a time when German leaders were<em> &ldquo;beginning to give the impression that they were no longer going to go along with this proxy war in Ukraine,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Macgregor said. He added, <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very clear that we have foreclosed Berlin&rsquo;s options. Berlin was drifting away from this alliance. [Chancellor] Olaf Scholz said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sending any more equipment. I won&rsquo;t send any tanks.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>Now he&rsquo;s in a bind because the United States has simply robbed him of the option of bailing out. Who&rsquo;s going to supply him gas and oil and coal and everything else if he bails out? Where does he turn now?</strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p>However, Macgregor said that such a strategy could backfire as the consequences of the Ukraine crisis cause more suffering among the German people. Just as Italians voted their leaders out, Scholz&rsquo;s ruling party may fall, he added. <em>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re on the very slippery, dangerous path that we never wanted to be on, which is the path to the end of NATO.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The Communist Party leader has compared the US-led alliance to Nazi Germany</strong></p> <p>Russia is currently involved in a confrontation with the <em>&ldquo;Fourth European NATO Reich,&rdquo;</em> the Communist Party (CPRF) leader, Gennady Zyuganov, claims.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;We must be well aware that a new army has gathered against us. The Fourth European NATO Reich, where thirty countries united all their regiments and armies,&rdquo;</em> Zyuganov said while addressing the State Duma on Monday.</p> <p>With his remark, the politician effectively compared the US-led NATO alliance to Nazi Germany, also known as the Third Reich. During WWII, several European allies and satellite states fought alongside Nazi Germany, while its own military incorporated numerous volunteer units provided by other European nations.</p> <p>Zyuganov made the statement as the Duma gathered to vote on the accession of the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics (DPR and LPR), as well as the former Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, to Russia. The legislation was passed unanimously.</p> ]]>

Russia recognized them as independent states in February shortly before the ongoing conflict broke out.</p> <p>Ukraine&rsquo;s southern Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions have been under Russian control since March. Both declared independence from Ukraine in the wake of last week&rsquo;s referendums and, along with the DPR and LPR, requested to be admitted into Russia.</p> <p>The referendums have been condemned by Kiev and its Western backers, who called the vote illegal despite the presence of international observers, and refused to recognize the outcome.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>A US regulator fined Kim Kardashian for not revealing she was paid to promote a cryptocurrency token on Instagram</strong></p> <p>US reality star Kim Kardashian has been hit with a $1.26 million fine over her failure to disclose she had been paid to promote EMAX cryptocurrency tokens on Instagram, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Monday.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agency fined Kardashian for &ldquo;<em>unlawfully touting</em>&rdquo; the token in a post she made last year on Instagram, where she has over 331 million followers and is one of the ten most popular users. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star was paid $250,000 by the token&rsquo;s creator EthereumMax for the post, which included a link to the company&rsquo;s website with instructions on how to purchase EMAX.&nbsp;</p> <p>On top of a $1 million penalty, the agency charged Kardashian $260,000, representing her payment for the post plus interest. She is also banned from promoting any cryptocurrencies for three years and must cooperate with what the SEC describes as an ongoing investigation.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that those investment products are right for all investors</em>,&rdquo; SEC chairman Gary Gensler said in the agency&rsquo;s statement, which was accompanied by a flashy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbZS6tYQKIM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube clip</a> warning that &ldquo;<em>celebrity endorsements don't mean that a product is right for you, or even, frankly, that it's legitimate</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Kardashian agreed to pay the fine and submit to the penalty without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings. With a net worth of $1.8 billion, according to Forbes, the sometime entrepreneur presumably didn't need the promotional fee.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, she is not the only celebrity to land in hot water for pushing EthereumMax&rsquo;s products to her followers. Boxer Floyd Mayweather and former Boston Celtics basketball player Paul Pierce were also on the company&rsquo;s payroll, and all three were sued in January by investors who claimed they had been duped by the celebrity hype and the company&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Despite its superficial resemblance to Ethereum, the second-largest coin in the crypto space, EthereumMax has no actual connection with the coin. &ldquo;<em>It would be akin to marketing a restaurant as &lsquo;McDonald&rsquo;sMax&rsquo; when it had no affiliation with McDonald&rsquo;s other than the name similarity and the fact that both companies sell food products</em>,&rdquo; the investors' complaint reads. EthereumMax's founders, Steve Gentile and Giovanni Perone, described as &ldquo;<em>a mysterious group of cryptocurrency developers</em>,&rdquo; were also named as co-defendants in the class-action suit.&nbsp;</p> <p>Apparently undeterred by her legal setbacks, Kardashian is reportedly expanding her prodigious brand into the financial sector, launching a private equity firm called SKYY Partners.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Energy giant Eni is working with Gazprom on the issue</strong></p> <p>Italian energy company Eni suggested on Monday that Russian gas supplies to the country could be restored this week. The stoppage was caused by regulatory issues in Austria and not by geopolitics, it said.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;The situation could be settled before the end of this week,&rdquo;</em> Eni&rsquo;s chief executive Claudio Descalzi stated, noting that the drop in flows from Russia's Gazprom via the Tarvisio entry point in northern Italy, which was identified on Saturday, is related to commercial reasons.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;It is due to the fact that Gazprom would have to pay a monetary guarantee for the transport of gas from Austria to Italy that was not there before,&rdquo;</em> Descalzi said, adding that the guarantee amounts to &euro;20 million ($19.6 million).</p> <p>According to the CEO, Eni was checking whether the Italian group could replace Gazprom or the Austrian operator for the physical transfer of Russian fuel that was already in Austria.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>On Saturday, Gazprom informed Eni that it wouldn&rsquo;t be able to supply gas to the country due to the <em>&ldquo;impossibility of transporting it&rdquo;</em> through Austria. The company explained on its Telegram channel that the gas flow had been suspended as a result of the refusal of the Austrian operator to confirm <em>&ldquo;transit nominations&rdquo;</em> due to regulatory changes that were introduced in Austria at the end of September.</p> <p><strong>For more stories on economy &amp; finance visit <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RT's business section</a></strong></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The country will not confiscate frozen property to support Ukraine, the Economy Ministry has said</strong></p> <p>Switzerland does not support Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky&rsquo;s request to hand over frozen Russian assets to Kiev, a spokesman for the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research, Fabian Maienfisch, told RIA Novosti on Monday.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;For the Swiss government, the confiscation of assets only on the basis of belonging to a state or being included in the sanctions list and using them to rebuild Ukraine is currently not an option of showing support for Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> Maienfisch said.</p> <p>The remarks come after Zelensky asked Switzerland last week to block Russian assets and transfer them to Ukraine.</p> <p>This is not the first time Kiev has demanded that the assets of wealthy Russians and the country&rsquo;s Central Bank reserves &ndash; which were frozen as part of Western sanctions &ndash; be seized. In May, addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelensky said that <em>&ldquo;Russian assets must be found and confiscated.&rdquo;</em> Later, Ukraine&rsquo;s prime minister proposed using the assets to help fund the reconstruction of the country, which was estimated at $750 billion.</p> <p>Switzerland agreed to join other Western nations in sanctioning Moscow, and in May, it reported that $6.50 billion in Russian assets were frozen. The country, however, rejected the idea of handing over the assets. Technically, they still belong to their Russian owners, even if they have no access to them, and their ownership is protected by European property rights.</p> <p>In July, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said it was important to protect individuals against the power of the state and to create a legal basis for confiscating funds.</p> <p><strong>For more stories on economy &amp; finance visit <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RT's business section</a></strong></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Crimea would remain Russian, and Ukraine – neutral, the tycoon has proposed</strong></p> <p>SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has proposed a plan to end the conflict in Ukraine. The billionaire suggested that new elections be held in the four regions that recently voted to join Russia, while Ukraine would commit to neutrality and relinquish its claim to Crimea.&nbsp;</p> <p>Musk posted an outline of his plan on Twitter on Monday, suggesting that Russia <em>&ldquo;redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision,&rdquo;</em> with Moscow withdrawing from these areas if voters choose.</p> <p>Crimea would be declared <em>&ldquo;formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783,&rdquo;</em> until Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gifted the peninsula to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954.&nbsp;</p> <p>Musk, whose text messages revealed him to be an occasional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/563886-elon-musk-rt-texts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reader of RT</a>, called Khrushchev&rsquo;s decision a <em>&ldquo;mistake.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>The billionaire then suggested that Ukraine commit to neutrality &ndash; as Russia had requested long before it launched its military operation in February &ndash; and guarantee the supply of water to Crimea. Ukraine shut down the supply in 2014 after Crimeans overwhelmingly voted to rejoin the Russian Federation. Shortly after the launch of Russia&rsquo;s operation in Ukraine, the supply was restored.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end,&rdquo;</em> Musk commented on his suggestion, adding that it is <em>&ldquo;just a question of how many people die before then.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>The plan is unlikely to find fans in Kiev. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has vowed not to negotiate with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and to seize the entirety of the territory Kiev claims as its own &ndash; including the Donbass republics and Crimea &ndash; by force. Furthermore, Zelensky sent an application for membership to the NATO alliance last week.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Residents of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye would likely vote in overwhelming numbers to join Russia if the recent referendums in these territories were held again. All of these regions have a high percentage of Russian speakers and have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/12/09/this-one-map-helps-explain-ukraines-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historically voted</a> for pro-Russian candidates while part of Ukraine.</p> <p>However, Putin has already signed treaties to accede these territories into the Russian Federation, and has vowed to defend them with Russia&rsquo;s full military capabilities.</p> <p>At the time of writing, nearly 60% of respondents on Twitter backed Musk&rsquo;s idea. That ratio is likely to change, however, as pro-Ukrainian Twitter users in the comments have called on &lsquo;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/562509-ukrainian-bots-in-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NAFO</a>&rsquo; trolls to swing the poll in their favor. In a follow-up&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1576976391597617153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>, Musk said that <em>&ldquo;the bot attack on this poll is strong!&rdquo;</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

They want to appoint their partner as an arbitrator, that sort of stuff doesn&rsquo;t work.</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;We get another [deadline], Tyson Fury says, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re telling you now, the fight is off unless you sign [today].&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re more than happy to continue those conversations, but what we&rsquo;ve been told is the deadline has passed.</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame Anthony Joshua for Tyson Fury pulling the plug twice on this fight,&rdquo;</em> Hearn added.</p> <p>Fury&rsquo;s US promoter and Top Rank chief Bob Arum has accused Hearn of trying to prevent the guaranteed box office smash from taking place to prolong Joshua's career.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Eddie Hearn is stalling everything, because he doesn&rsquo;t want the fight to happen,&rdquo;</em> Arum <a href="https://talksport.com/sport/boxing/1208335/bob-arum-eddie-hearn-fury-vs-joshua-fight/">said</a> to talkSPORT.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;And why doesn&rsquo;t he want the fight to happen? Because Joshua&rsquo;s lost three out of his last five fights and he figures to lose again if he fights Tyson Fury and so Eddie is in effect being an impediment.</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any issues, he sends a draft and then Frank and George [Warren] reply and then we don&rsquo;t hear from Eddie for days, he&rsquo;s stalling until it dies of its own volition.</em></p> ]]>

But, Eddie doesn&rsquo;t and so Eddie is doing whatever he can to prevent the fight from happening,&rdquo;</em> Arum added.</p> <p>Ahead of Hearn stating that the megafight was off, he reminded boxing fans that Arum said <em>&ldquo;no chance this fight happens&rdquo;</em> a fortnight ago.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Now apparently there's no barriers and it's my fault. If you ask Bob what day it is, there's only a 50% chance he'd get it right,&rdquo;</em> Hearn joked.</p> <p>Promoting the Londoner as well, Hearn claims that Fury sent a contract for Derek Chisora to sign on Friday, which is a further indicator that Fury has given up on fighting Joshua.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>It is “highly unlikely” Putin will use such weapons in the Ukraine conflict, Ben Wallace has said</strong></p> <p>UK Secretary of Defense Ben Wallace said he does not believe Russian President Vladimir Putin will resort to using tactical nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, PA Media reported on Sunday.</p> <p>Speaking at a fringe event organized by the Tory party-affiliated think tank Onward, Wallace was responding to Putin&rsquo;s comments from earlier this month in which he said Russia would use <em>&ldquo;all the means at [its] disposal&rdquo;</em> if the country&rsquo;s territorial integrity were threatened. Wallace said the prospect of Putin launching nukes against Kiev&rsquo;s forces was <em>&ldquo;highly unlikely.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Wallace said that even though Russia&rsquo;s nuclear doctrine does provide for the use of nuclear weapons in certain instances, such a move would prompt a strong reaction from Moscow&rsquo;s allies in India and China.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Putin was given a very clear sense of what is acceptable and unacceptable&rdquo;</em> in meetings with the Indian and Chinese leadership, Wallace said, according to PA.</p> ]]>

He insisted that <em>&ldquo;retired idiots with generals&rsquo; stripes&rdquo;</em> should not attempt to intimidate Moscow by claiming NATO would attack Crimea.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Hypersonic [missiles] are sure to hit targets in Europe and the US much faster,</em>&rdquo; Medvedev warned, adding that <em>&ldquo;the Western establishment and NATO citizens need to understand that Russia has chosen its own path&rdquo;</em> and there is<em> &ldquo;no way back.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>US media target Republican senator for previous vote on emergency funding</strong></p> <p>As Florida counted the deaths and damage caused by Hurricane Ian, Senator Marco Rubio found himself questioned by ABC and CNN about another storm a decade ago. Both outlets brought up Rubio&rsquo;s vote against Hurricane Sandy funding, asking if he will vote against helping his home state this time. Rubio, a Republican, explained he voted against the Sandy relief bill because it had been <em>&ldquo;loaded up&rdquo;</em> with non-emergency items.</p> <p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Why should other senators vote for relief for your state when you didn&rsquo;t vote for a package to help theirs?&rdquo;</em> CNN&rsquo;s Dana Bash asked Rubio on her Sunday show, referring to the $50 billion bill to help New Jersey and other northeast states hit in 2012.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I voted for every disaster relief package that&rsquo;s clean,&rdquo;</em> Rubio replied, pointing out that the Sandy relief bill included funding for <em>&ldquo;a roof for a museum in Washington DC, for fisheries in Alaska, it had been loaded up with a bunch of things that had nothing to do with disaster relief.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><strong></strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/563757-hurricane-florida-deadliest-ian/"></a>ABC&rsquo;s Noah Karl also questioned Rubio about his Sandy vote, demanding to know if the Florida Republican would <em>&ldquo;take the same stand&rdquo;</em> when his own state was on the line. Again, Rubio said he had voted for many disaster relief bills, but objected to the provisions that should have gone through regular procedure, from the Smithsonian roof to new cars for Homeland Security.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><em>&ldquo;What I won't support is things that are not emergency relief,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;the senator insisted.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong></strong>Both Bash and Karl demanded to know if Rubio would vote against Ian relief if it contained funding for unrelated matters, to which the senator replied that Florida won&rsquo;t ask for unrelated funds, so the question was moot.</p> <p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;It's our state, so if we're not asking for that and we&rsquo;re saying we don't need it and it has nothing to do with emergency relief for Florida then why would it be in there?&rdquo;</em> Rubio told the ABC host.</p> <p><strong></strong>Media and Democrats have also attacked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another Republican, over his handling of Hurricane Ian. The Category Five storm that hit last week killed at least 88 people, displaced more than 40,000 and caused billions in property damage.</p> <p>Current polls show Rubio four points ahead of Democrat challenger Val Demings &ndash; a former manager in the first impeachment trial of President Donald Trump &ndash; ahead of the November midterm election. DeSantis is six points ahead of Democrat Charlie Crist.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Anti-government unrest was “a design” of Washington and Tel Aviv, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said</strong></p> <p>In his first public statement following weeks of violent protests across Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused the US and Israel of inciting the unrest, with the help of <em>&ldquo;traitorous Iranians abroad.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;I say explicitly that these riots and this insecurity were a design by the US and the occupying, fake Zionist regime and those who are paid by them&rdquo;</em> Khamenei told graduating officers at a police academy in Tehran on Monday. The Ayatollah also blamed <em>&ldquo;traitorous Iranians abroad,&rdquo;</em> arguing that the US and its allies feel that Iran <em>&ldquo;is progressing towards full-scale power and they can&rsquo;t tolerate this.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Protests erupted in cities and towns across Iran more than two weeks ago, following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. Amini had been arrested for wearing an <em>&ldquo;improper&rdquo;</em> hijab.</p> <p>Amini&rsquo;s family insists that she was beaten to death while the Iranian authorities claim that she died of a heart attack.

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The former Ukrainian territories have large industrial and agricultural potential</strong></p> <p>On Monday, Russia's State Duma ratified the treaties on the accession of the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics (DPR and LPR), as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, to the Russian Federation.&nbsp;The territories overwhelmingly voted to join the country in referendums in September.&nbsp;</p> <p>Economists say the restoration of the conflict-ravaged territories will take huge investment, noting, however, that the returns may be even greater. RT looks at the economic cost as well as the benefits of integrating the territories into Russia.</p> <ol> <li><strong>What are the new regions?</strong><br />The total area of Donbass, Kherson and Zaporozhye is almost 109,000 square kilometers (42,085 square miles,) or over 15% of Ukraine&rsquo;s former total area. More than eight million people previously lived in the territories,&nbsp;which have more than 5.6 million hectares of arable land. Moscow has yet to determine the future borders of Kherson and Zaporozhye, parts of which are still controlled by Ukrainian troops.<br /><strong></strong></li> <li><strong>What are the drivers of the Donbass economy?</strong><br />Donbass with its coal-based economy was Ukraine's industrial heartland. The DPR accounted for 20% of the country&rsquo;s industrial production as far as 2014. The mineral-rich region has the fourth-largest coal field in Europe, with its extractable reserves estimated at over 10 billion tons. As of February, 115 coal mines were operating in Donbass, producing around 70 million tons of raw material per year. Eight power plants are also located&nbsp;in the Donetsk region.<br /><br />The&nbsp;LPR is an important transport hub and is known for its metallurgy, machinery and agricultural industries. It also has chemical and pharmaceutical plants and several coal mines. A number of important transit highways pass through the republic. Authorities in LPR say its agricultural potential is great, with a focus on the cultivation of grain.<br /><strong></strong></li> <li><strong>Why is Zaporozhye important?</strong><br />Zaporozhye Region is the center of energy supply, with its three powerful energy producers: the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, the Dnepr Hydroelectric Station and the Botievo wind farm. In 2019&ndash;2020, Zaporozhye produced about 40 billion kWh of electricity per year, which is approximately 25&ndash;27% of the entire energy sector in Ukraine. The region has a number of large industrial and mechanical engineering facilities, including the Zaporozhye Automobile Building Plant (ZAZ) with an output of 150,000 vehicles a year. The Dnieper River, the Kakhovka Reservoir and the Sea of Azov play a significant role in Zaporozhye&rsquo;s economy, which also has great potential for industrial fish farming.<br /><strong></strong></li> <li><strong>What&rsquo;s the significance of Kherson?</strong><br /> <p>Kherson Region specializes in shipbuilding and is known for its resorts and agriculture. It had the largest territory of arable land in Ukraine, at almost 20,000 square kilometers. The region produces cereals, sunflowers and vegetables. The fertile land allows two or sometimes even three harvests a season. Other traditional industries there are cattle breeding and winemaking. There are plans to develop a resort and tourist cluster on the territory, which has access to both the Azov and Black Sea.</p> <strong></strong></li> <li><strong>What challenges does Russia face?</strong><br />Russia obtained land with incredible agricultural and industrial potential, but with highly degraded infrastructure. The government&rsquo;s primary concern is to integrate those territories and help them overcome the economic development gap, and to recover from the destruction inflicted by the conflict. Initially, Moscow will finance the budgets of the four regions. In the future as integration deepens and the economy is restarted, the volume of transfers from the federal budget will decrease, experts say.<br /><strong></strong></li> <li><strong>How could Donbass, Zaporozhye, and Kherson contribute to the Russian economy?</strong><br />The territories have an extremely advantageous geographical location. They offer vast opportunities due to the presence of ports and maritime routes with the south of Russia. Access to the key port of Mariupol in the Azov Sea means a potential increase of coal and other supplies to Africa and South Asian countries. The regions can contribute to both ensuring the nation&rsquo;s food security and to increased export supplies to &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; states. Experts estimate the potential contribution to the Russian economy could be worth trillions of rubles or even more.</li> </ol> <p><strong>For more stories on economy &amp; finance visit <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RT's business section</a></strong></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>An investigation has been launched at Belgium’s Tihange 3 while the reactor is closed</strong></p> <p>One of Belgium&rsquo;s six functioning nuclear reactors has shut down unexpectedly, the plant&rsquo;s operator Engie told VRT News on Monday. The reactor, called Tihange 3, underwent an automatic shutdown at around 8:25am local time at which point &ldquo;<em>employees then brought the power plant into a safe condition</em>,&rdquo; the company said. The reasons for the stoppage are unclear but an investigation into the incident has been launched.</p> <p>According to local media, the unexpected shutdown of a reactor that provided 1,038 megawatts of electricity to Belgium would not jeopardize the country&rsquo;s energy supply.</p> <p>Belgium shut down one of the reactors at its Doel plant &ldquo;<em>for good</em>&rdquo; just over a week ago, following through on long-held plans to dismantle its nuclear energy infrastructure even as the EU finds itself in an energy crisis. Electrabel, which runs the Doel plant, explained that the company was merely fulfilling a 2003 agreement to enact a &ldquo;<em>gradual phase-out of nuclear energy for industrial electricity production.</em>&rdquo;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Belgium&rsquo;s reactors had previously supplied half of the country&rsquo;s electricity needs. All were due to close by 2025 until the government signed a tentative agreement with Electrabel in March to potentially extend the life of the two newest reactors by ten years. This came amid concern about the country&rsquo;s increasing dependence on fossil fuels, especially from Russia. The unexpectedly stricken Tihange 3 thus had its demise postponed until 2035, as did another reactor at the Doel plant. However, the deal is not binding and efforts to similarly extend the life of the neighboring Tihange 2 reactor past its planned shutdown date of February 1, 2023 were rebuffed in July.</p> <p>The Belgian government has stressed that clinging to its once-scorned nuclear energy capacity in the EU&rsquo;s time of need should not be seen as discarding its commitment to renewable energy. At the same time as it revealed the draft agreement to keep Tihange 3 and Doel 4 operational until 2035, it announced a &euro;1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) investment in wind, hydrogen, and solar energy &ldquo;<em>to give a boost to the transition to climate neutrality</em>.&rdquo; The investment will also pay for small modular nuclear reactors. As early as 2007, Belgian scientists were warning that closing the country&rsquo;s nuclear plants would double the price of energy, harm the country's energy independence, and increase its reliance on fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p> <p>Costs are already at or near record highs across the EU due to sanctions on Russian energy, a situation exacerbated by last week&rsquo;s alleged sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline that had previously carried Russian gas to Europe.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Despite opposition from multiple members, the bloc wants to press ahead with the controversial step</strong></p> <p>The European Union will reportedly not impose an eighth round of sanctions on Moscow unless its member states agree to include a price cap on Russian oil exports.</p> <p>This move has been opposed by several states and could further damage the bloc&rsquo;s already reeling economy.</p> <p>EU ambassadors met in Brussels on Monday morning in a bid to hammer out an agreement. In addition to penalties on Russian politicians and export restrictions on chemicals, electronics and aviation components, the leadership wants to impose a price cap on seaborne Russian oil exports.</p> <p>Despite opposition from Hungary &ndash; which has opposed any further sanctioning of Russian energy &ndash; and pushback from Greece, Cyprus and Malta, an EU diplomat told <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/sanctions-haggling-macron-scholz-meetup-eu-israel-buzz-dims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a> that <em>&ldquo;there will be no sanctions package without the oil price cap.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>The restriction would work by placing an embargo on all seaborne oil imports from Russia priced above a certain point. The amount would be set just above the cost of production, giving Russian producers just enough revenue to stay in business, while denying them the record profits they have been reaping since earlier sanctions drove market prices skyward.&nbsp;</p> <p>The embargo would likely be enforced by shipping insurance firms, which would deny insurance to consignments of oil priced above the fixed point.</p> <p>However, Russia could respond by simply refusing to ship its oil to countries paying such low prices, and sell it to other foreign buyers. Turkey, China and India are the three largest non-EU importers of Russian fossil fuels, and none would be obliged to abide by the new sanctions. While 90% of the global oil shipping fleet is insured by London-based firms (the UK supports the price cap), China and India already accept cover from Russian insurance companies.</p> <p>Hungary has opposed not just the price cap, but any sanctions on Russian energy, while Greece, Cyprus and Malta have large shipping industries and worry that the new package could deprive them of vital revenue, Politico reported, citing multiple diplomats.</p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>A giant cloud had some in Nevada wondering if the US had renewed nuclear tests</strong></p> <p>People in Las Vegas shared photos of a mushroom-shaped cloud billowing on the horizon on Sunday, with some joking that it reminded them of nuclear tests &mdash; one of Sin City&rsquo;s tourist attractions in the 1950s.</p> <p>The unnerving sight was apparently made more eerie by rays of the setting sun coloring the cloud various shades of orange.</p> <p>Thunderclouds can take a mushroom-like shape when an upward current draws them to a higher altitude but at which there is no strong wind to blow them away. The San Diego office of the National Weather Service shared a photo of a similar-looking cloud on Monday, but without the dramatic lighting, as it moved west over California.</p> <p>The US tested over a thousand nuclear devices at its Nevada Test Site, 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, over four decades.

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The situation in the region is ‘under control,’ according to deputy head Kirill Stremousov</strong></p> <p>Attempts by Ukrainian forces to break through Russia&rsquo;s defenses in Kherson Region have been thwarted, the deputy head of the local administration, Kirill Stremousov, has said.</p> <p>In a Telegram post on Monday, Stremousov stated that <em>&ldquo;everything is under control in the Nikolayev direction,&rdquo;</em> despite Kiev&rsquo;s efforts to retake the region. He noted that Ukraine&rsquo;s forces had advanced southward along the Dnieper River to the village of Dudchany before <em>&ldquo;taking a beating&rdquo;</em> from Russian Aerospace Forces.</p> <p><strong></strong>The official admitted that the Ukrainians were able to advance a little bit, but noted that the region&rsquo;s defense systems were working and that <em>&ldquo;at the moment, the situation is completely under control.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><strong></strong>Stremousov concluded by urging people not to give into panic because of what they hear and read on social media. <em>&ldquo;This is not Kharkov, this is not [Krasny] Liman, we are holding the fence,&rdquo;</em> he proclaimed.</p> <p><strong></strong>Russia&rsquo;s Defense Ministry has also confirmed repelling the attack, stating that over 400 Ukrainian servicemen, 43 tanks and 89 units of special military equipment were eliminated in the Nikolayev-Krivoy Rog area.</p> <p><strong></strong>The announcement comes as Kiev&rsquo;s forces have mounted large-scale offensives along several points of engagement with Russia. On Saturday, Russian troops were forced to withdraw from their defensive positions in the town of Krasny Liman in the Donetsk People&rsquo;s Republic after they were nearly encircled by Ukrainian forces, which had brought in reserves and reached a <em>&ldquo;considerable superiority in men and material.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>It has been noted, however, that the Ukrainian side has been suffering significant casualties in the offensive, having reportedly lost over 500 soldiers (200 dead, 320 injured), as well as ten tanks and 25 infantry fighting vehicles during the attack on Krasny Liman, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.</p> <p><strong></strong>Kiev&rsquo;s offensive comes after President Vladimir Putin signed treaties on the accession of the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics, as well as the Russian-held regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, into the Russian Federation on Friday. The move came after the four territories overwhelmingly voted in favor of joining Russia in referendums held between September 23 and 27.</p> <p><strong></strong>Ukraine and Western nations have refused to recognize the results of the referendums and have vowed to never acknowledge the regions as being part of Russia.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The bloc should “very seriously consider” penalizing Ankara as it “regularly undermines” EU and NATO interests, Jurgen Trittin says</strong></p> <p>The EU should consider taking<em> &ldquo;economic measures&rdquo;</em> against T&uuml;rkiye over its stance in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, tensions with Greece, and other issues, a senior German MP, Jurgen Trittin, believes. Formerly minister for the environment and now the head of foreign policy in Germany&rsquo;s Green Party, Trittin made the remarks in an interview with the Greek newspaper Kathimerini published on Monday.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Turkey regularly undermines the common interests of the EU and NATO. It undermines the sanctions policy against Russia, acts against international law in Syria, prevents the control of the UN arms embargo against Libya and violates the sovereign rights of Greece, a NATO ally and EU member,&rdquo;</em> Trittin stated, referring to T&uuml;rkiye by its old name in English.</p> <p>The MP also launched a personal attack at Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, accusing him of pursuing solely domestic political goals while <em>&ldquo;ignoring&rdquo;</em> common Euro-Atlantic interests. The EU should target Ankara with economic restrictions to send a strong message that T&uuml;rkiye itself needs the bloc the most, Trittin suggested.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>Since there are no sanction mechanisms within NATO, nor is it possible to expel a member, the EU must very seriously consider taking economic measures and sanctioning Turkey. Turkey needs the European market and it needs the alliance with NATO. This must be made very clear to it.</strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p>Ankara has long aspired to become an EU member, originally launching its bid back in 1987. The process has been extremely slow, however, with formal candidate status achieved only in 1999.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Little to no progress has been made since then, while T&uuml;rkiye has had repeated run-ins with the bloc over various foreign policy issues. It has failed to meet the political and economic criteria outlined by Brussels for it to become a full-fledged member, while ties with the EU have been gradually deteriorating since 2016, following the failed coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat attempt in the country and tensions over the influx of migrants.</p> <p>In recent months, Ankara has found itself at odds with Brussels over its ambiguous position on the Ukraine crisis. T&uuml;rkiye has refused to join the Western sanctions against Russia, maintaining ties with both Moscow and Kiev and seeking to play the role of mediator in the ongoing conflict. T&uuml;rkiye has also experienced renewed tensions with its long-time adversary &ndash; and NATO ally &ndash; Greece, with the two nations embroiled in a bitter spat over the alleged militarization of the Aegean Islands by Athens.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The country has seen a near 200% increase in applications this year</strong></p> <p>Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer declared on Monday that the European Union&rsquo;s asylum system has failed, after his country saw a record 56,000 refugee applications this year. Together with Hungary&rsquo;s Viktor Orban and Serbia&rsquo;s Aleksandar Vucic, Nehammer proposed tightening border security.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Austria is currently heavily burdened by illegal migration. The solidarity contribution that we are making in Europe is disproportionately high,&rdquo;</em> Nehammer stated at a summit with Orban and Vucic in Budapest, according to Austria&rsquo;s Kronen Zeitung newspaper.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;The asylum policy has failed. There is still no strong EU external border protection, and the reality of the problem is being disregarded,&rdquo;</em> the chancellor added.<strong><br /><br /></strong>Under the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;Effective Solidarity&rsquo; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/promoting-our-european-way-life/new-pact-migration-and-asylum/effective-solidarity_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">program</a>, wealthier member states are encouraged to accept migrants rejected by other nations struggling to handle the influx. If these wealthy countries refuse, other members are asked to take what the European Commission terms <em>&ldquo;their fair share&rdquo;</em> of the migrants.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Some 56,149 asylum applications were filed in Austria between January and August this year, according to the country&rsquo;s interior ministry. This represents an increase of 195% on the same period last year. The ministry noted that most of the applications were made by Indian nationals, who have no chance of actually being granted asylum due to their arrival from a safe country.</p> <p>Pakistanis, Moroccans and Tunisians are also among those claiming asylum, with their cases highly likely to be rejected.</p> <p><em>"As long as the EU does not intervene with efficient measures, we will have to help ourselves,&rdquo;</em> Nehammer said on Monday.<em> &ldquo;Austria is therefore doing everything possible to protect itself, and we want to take further measures together with Serbia and Hungary. Because if the Serbian and Hungarian borders are protected, our own frontier is also protected."</em></p> <p>Austria has used its military to impose border controls on several occasions since millions of migrants began pouring into Europe in 2015, and last year deployed an additional 400 soldiers at its frontier with Hungary. Orban has taken an even tougher stance, and constructed a double-layer fence along its borders with Croatia and Serbia, while immediately expelling migrants deemed inadmissible. Belgrade <a href="https://asylumineurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AIDA-SR_2020update.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rejects</a> most asylum applications.</p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Spokesman was responding to a weekend call from the head of Chechnya</strong></p> <p>Emotions should play no role when discussing the use of nuclear weapons, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said, adding that Moscow has a clear policy in this regard. His comments came shortly after Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the Chechen Republic, suggested that Russia should use &ldquo;<em>low-yield nuclear weapons</em>&rdquo; against Ukraine.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters on Monday, Peskov said that governors and heads of regions in Russia have the right to express their personal opinion and to &ldquo;<em>give assessments</em>&rdquo; on issues. This includes Kadyrov, who Peskov said has &ldquo;<em>contributed a lot</em>&rdquo; to Russia&rsquo;s military campaign in Ukraine.</p> <p>That, however, does not mean officials can give free rein to their emotions, &ldquo;<em>even in difficult times,&rdquo;</em> Peskov said.</p> <p>Asked if Kadyrov&rsquo;s remark could be considered an inappropriate display of emotion, the Kremlin spokesman said that in Russia, the use of nuclear weapons &ldquo;<em>is based on what is laid down in the respective doctrine.</em>&rdquo;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The current turmoil in British politics can lead to disastrous consequences. It also mirrors the current state of the wider West</strong></p> <p>Even fervent believers in the stability of Western democracies must surely have had their faith shaken last week by the extraordinary economic and political crises created by the newly-minted UK prime minister, Liz Truss.</p> <p>In the week after the prime minister&rsquo;s hand-picked chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, handed down a &lsquo;mini-budget&rsquo; on September 23, the English pound crashed; the government bond market took a dive; interest and mortgage rates rose; some mortgage markets shut down; the Bank of England staged a highly unusual fiscal intervention to prevent the collapse of major pension funds; and the IMF criticized Truss in a manner usually reserved for the leaders of debt-ridden banana republics.</p> <p>The global importance of these events and the ongoing economic and political disruption that they will inevitably cause should not be underestimated. Political commentator Alastair Campbell, formerly Tony Blair&rsquo;s chief of staff, accurately described last week as <em>&ldquo;the week that everything changed.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>What led to the UK economic crisis?</p> ]]>
  <![CDATA[ <blockquote> <span><strong>Read more</strong></span> <figure> <img src="https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.10/thumbnail/633aaf9385f5406cec22ea5e.jpg" alt="British Prime Minister Liz Truss in London, October 1, 2022. © AP Photo / Alberto Pezzali" /> <figcaption><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/563952-liz-truss-worst-approval/">Truss already less popular than disgraced Johnson – poll</a></figcaption> </figure> </blockquote> ]]>
  <![CDATA[ <p>Quite simply, the fact that the Truss mini-budget provided for billions of pounds worth of unfunded and uncosted tax cuts &ndash; including, most provocatively, a cut in the 45% top level income tax rate &ndash; caused the financial markets to register a serious vote of no confidence in the Truss government, with all the attendant consequences that followed.</p> <p>Incidentally, the events of last week show where real power ultimately lies in the West &ndash; and it is definitely not with politicians. &nbsp;</p> <p>Truss&rsquo;s mini-budget is, of course, a product of the crude neo-liberal economic ideology that she so fanatically believes in, and which proved decisive in attracting the 80,000 or so Thatcher-worshipping members of the Tory party that anointed Truss prime minister only a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p> <p>Faced with an economic disaster entirely of her own making &ndash; one of her first acts as prime minister was to sack the head of the Treasury &ndash; Truss simply doubled down, and retreated petulantly to her Downing Street bunker.&nbsp;</p> <p>She did emerge briefly late last week to do a round of disastrous radio interviews with regional BBC stations &ndash; in which Truss continued to robotically tout the benefits of &lsquo;trickle-down economics&rsquo;, and (unsuccessfully) tried to blame the economic crisis entirely on Russian President Vladimir Putin and the conflict in Ukraine.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the vast majority of commentators in the UK &ndash; irrespective of their political affiliations &ndash; have been strongly critical of the Truss mini-budget and the prime minister herself. Even Daily Telegraph columnist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard accused Truss of having <em>&ldquo;embarked on a course of sheer madness.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Truss&rsquo; intransigence, however, means that the current economic crisis can only intensify &ndash; with predictions of a housing market crash as the next most likely catastrophe to engulf the UK. &nbsp;</p> <p>The ongoing UK rail strike ramped up last week, and further economic convulsions will no doubt occur in late November when Truss and Kwarteng have condescended to outline the vast array of spending cuts that will fund the mini-budget tax cuts.&nbsp;</p> <p>Truss&rsquo; attempt to remedy the deep-seated problems that bedevil the UK economy (including decades of wage stagnation, ongoing working class and middle-class impoverishment, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor, dramatically rising energy and food prices, and the crisis in housing affordability) by applying neo-liberal economic policies has failed spectacularly.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>This is an ominous sign for Western democracies generally, because significant segments of the global elites that rule them remain firm adherents of the greed-based, crude neo-liberal economic theories that Truss and Kwarteng so rigidly embrace. These elites do not believe in noblesse oblige and are committed to overturning the social democratic consensus that prevailed in the UK from Atlee until the election of Thatcher.</p> <p>Irrespective of that, what should be of most concern to intelligent observers is the demonstrable fragility of an economic system that descends into severe crisis within a few days of a mini-budget &ndash; no matter how misguided and foolish &ndash; being handed down.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, the political crisis created by Truss is perhaps even more serious than the economic crisis that she has unthinkingly engendered.</p> <p>The immediate political dilemma is the one now confronting the Tory party.</p> <p>Such has been the intensity of the adverse reaction to the events of the past week that it is already clear that the Conservatives cannot possibly win the next election, and that Truss cannot realistically remain prime minister for long.</p> <p>A poll taken at the end of last week shows that the Labour Party now leads the Tories by an astounding 33 percentage points &ndash; up from 17 points just prior to the handing down of the mini-budget.&nbsp;</p> <p>In one week, Truss has done what no Labour leader has been able to do in decades &ndash; namely, give Labour a seemingly unassailable lead in the polls. Truss also appears to have brought about a significant rapprochement between Keir Starmer and the trade union leadership, and invigorated the party generally.&nbsp;</p> <p>As for Truss herself, as Alastair Campbell said last week <em>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead&hellip; she&rsquo;s toast.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Under existing Tory party rules, however, Truss cannot be challenged for 12 months &ndash; and, even if she could be, a new leader would have to be elected by the same lengthy and deeply flawed process that so recently threw up Truss as party leader.</p> <p>The only way out of this dire situation would be for Truss to resign, and be replaced without the need for a leadership contest. But Truss shows absolutely no signs of relinquishing her position, and even if she did, the ensuing divisions within the Tory party would surely make a leadership contest inevitable.</p> <p>Of course, yet another change of Tory leader would render the party even more unelectable than it is now.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Under the circumstances, there is, I think, a very real possibility that the Tory party will split, with the Truss neo-liberal wing hiving off, leaving a Cameronesque rump behind. A new right-wing populist party may emerge from such a split. If so, this would mirror what has occurred within conservative parties in some other Western democracies in recent years.</p> <p>But whatever happens, there can be no doubt that the hapless Truss will have the privilege of having presided over the demise, in whatever precise form that it takes, of the contemporary Tory party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Tory party conference that began in Birmingham on Sunday &ndash; it has understandably been boycotted by a large number of angry and disgruntled backbenchers &ndash; promises to be a very interesting event indeed. It started off badly for Truss with prominent Tory MP Michael Gove condemning her mini-budget as being <em>&ldquo;not Conservative&rdquo;</em> and hinting that he and other Tory MPs might vote against the Truss tax cuts in Parliament. This caused Truss to panic and reverse the upper income tax rate cut, which only further damaged her credibility.</p> <p>The political crisis that is currently intensifying in the UK has highlighted a number of inherent defects within the political system that currently operates in most Western democracies. They include the following:&nbsp;</p> <p>First, it is clear that any political system that allows a genuine prime minister like Boris Johnson to be deposed for a few minor misdemeanors, and replaced by someone as demonstrably incompetent as Liz Truss, is irretrievably broken.</p> <p>Second, any political system that encourages and permits a rapid and regular turnover of leaders &ndash; sadly a defining characteristic of politics in the West these days &ndash; can only perpetuate ongoing general political instability.</p> <p>Third, party leaders should be elected by members of Parliament, not the party membership. Election by members debases the quality of candidates and policies alike, and leads to ongoing instability and destabilization in circumstances, as is often the case, where the elected leader does not command the support of a majority of parliamentarians. This was the case under Jeremy Corbyn&rsquo;s recent leadership of the Labour Party, and it is now certainly the case with Truss.</p> <p>Fourth, politics needs to attract a far better quality of politician than it currently does.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Fifth, if the Conservative Party does split, this may lead to a particularly dangerous consequence, namely the formation of a new right-wing populist party of the kind that has recently emerged in Germany, Sweden, Italy, and elsewhere in the West. Such a development can only destabilize politics further, as it has done in each of those countries.&nbsp;</p> <p>Whether it is possible to achieve any of the abovementioned reforms or prevent the emergence of a populist party in the UK are, I think, very much open questions.</p> <p>It has always been obvious that Truss is a fourth-rate politician. She is completely lacking in real intelligence, empathy with voters, and political judgment. But Truss is no worse than the average politician who these days regularly attains high office in Western democracies.&nbsp;</p> <p>I doubt that Truss will survive as prime minister for much longer, and she would seem to have no future beyond that in politics.&nbsp;</p> <p>Perhaps her most significant political achievement is to have dramatically highlighted, in the short space of a week, the inherent and fundamental instability that underpins the economic and political systems that currently hold sway in the West.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The remaining, undamaged, pipeline section is being emptied of gas for inspection</strong></p> <p>Russian gas flow to European customers may be resumed via the remaining Nord Stream 2 string after Gazprom checks that it&rsquo;s working correctly, the Russian state energy major said in a statement on Monday.</p> <p>The string &ndash; Line B of the pipeline &ndash; was not damaged in last week&rsquo;s explosions that punctured Line A and both strings of Nord Stream 1.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>Gazprom is working to depressurize Line B of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. To do this, the company is pumping the natural gas out of the pipe. This will make it possible to safely inspect the integrity of string B and reduce potential environmental risks from possible gas leaks. If the decision to start gas deliveries via Nord Stream 2 string B is made, natural gas will be pumped into the pipeline after the system integrity is checked and confirmation by supervisory authorities is granted,</em>&rdquo; the statement says.</p> <p>Danish authorities reported leaks on three strings of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines last week after a local operator noted a loss of pressure following a series of undersea explosions in the area. Prior to the incident which is now being investigated, Russia supplied gas to the EU via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Nord Stream 2, while having been ready for operation and filled with gas since last year, has not been used for exports due to EU sanctions and the reluctance of European officials to grant it certification.</p> <p>Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Saturday that the gas routes can be repaired, but the process will be costly and time-consuming. According to him, Moscow&rsquo;s first step will be to find the culprit behind the attack.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The French president wants non-EU states to get on board with Brussels’ foreign policy</strong></p> <p>Russia has expressed skepticism about an upcoming gathering of European nations that, despite having a vague official purpose, appears to be aimed at countering Russian and Chinese influence on the continent.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;The creation of new blocs will certainly not foster stability and predictability or help to defuse the tense situation that we live in,&rdquo;</em> Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.</p> <p>The official was speaking about the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), which is slated for Thursday. The new French-proposed club is meant to bring together the 27 EU members and 17 nations that either aspire to join it or have traditionally close ties to it, such as Norway and the UK.</p> <p>Although the idea was given a boost when UK Prime Minister Liz Truss agreed to participate in the first meeting, doubts reportedly remain about the viability of the project, which was originally proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;The British took a very pragmatic tactic: if you cannot &lsquo;kill&rsquo; the strange initiative, it is better to engage deeply and to direct it in your own way,&rdquo;</em> a European diplomat told Reuters about Truss' decision to attend the summit in Prague.</p> <p>The forum was initially rejected by some intended members, particularly Ukraine, which perceived it as a French ploy to stall its desired accession to the EU.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><em>&ldquo;Strategic ambiguity on Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective practiced by some EU capitals in the past years has failed and must end. It only emboldened [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,&rdquo;</em> Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba declared in May, when Macron first proposed the idea.</p> <p>Kiev and other Eastern European participants have since somewhat warmed up to the EPC, though much skepticism remains, diplomats told Reuters.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;It will be just another 'blah blah' forum to discuss &hellip; but after a few meetings it might finish without any big success,&rdquo;</em> a diplomatic source quoted by the news agency on Monday predicted.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;There are too many countries with too many interests &hellip; How do you have Serbia and talk about Russia? How do you have Turkey and Greece/Cyprus together? How to have Armenia and Azerbaijan at the same table?&rdquo;</em> the diplomat asked.</p> <p>Though it lacks a coherent agenda, the EPC is largely viewed as a vehicle for the EU to bring closer aspiring members that may be frustrated by the lack of progress in their accession, Reuters said. In particular, countries in the Western Balkans may look to Russia and China for possible investments and other benefits, a prospect that France seeks to counter with this initiative.</p> <p>Another apparent target for the diplomatic drive is T&uuml;rkiye, which refused to join the EU&rsquo;s efforts to isolate Russia commercially and politically in retaliation for its military operation against Ukraine. Unlike the EU, Ankara has preserved its ties with Moscow and is attempting to adopt the role of mediator in the conflict.</p> ]]>

He added, however, that there is no imminent danger to the capital.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;There are chances, of course, because [Putin] will never give up intentions to conquer Ukraine and our country&rsquo;s capital. Indeed, it is among the priorities of his criminal plans,&rdquo;</em> Nayev, who commands the Joint Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told the TV channel TSN on Monday.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;At present, there is no such threat because we are not seeing a concentration of the invasion forces. What will happen next? Everything depends on [Putin&rsquo;s] decisions, as well as on the availability of forces and equipment.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The US Army fell 25% short of its recruitment targets this year, officials admitted</strong></p> <p>The US Army has failed to hit its recruiting goals this year, falling 15,000 soldiers short of its 60,000 target, officials said.</p> <p>Others&nbsp;branches&nbsp;of the country's armed forces, such as the Air Force, Navy and Marines, managed to reach their enlistment goals, but only after digging into their pools of rejected or delayed-entry applicants.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;In the Army&rsquo;s most challenging recruiting year since the start of the all-volunteer force, we will only achieve 75% of our fiscal year '22 recruiting goal,"</em> Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said in a statement to the Associated Press on Friday.&nbsp;</p> <p>She added that if the Army continues to experience recruiting challenges, it will draw on the National Guard and Reserve to augment active-duty forces.</p> <p>The military now reportedly fears that enlistment will continue to plummet next year. The Marine Corps usually has about half of its recruitment target achieved at the beginning of each fiscal year, but has only secured about 30% for 2023 so far, unnamed officials told the AP. Meanwhile, the Navy, which usually opens the&nbsp;fiscal year at about 25% of recruitment, reports 10% of the target so far, they said.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Military leaders tried a number of methods to build up their ranks this year, such as increasing enlistment bonuses, dropping high school diploma requirements, and lowering physical standards. However, the AP noted that many potential recruits are drawn to private industry in what is a tight labor market.</p> <p>Corporations such as McDonald&rsquo;s have also begun introducing perks such as tuition benefits, similar to those used by the military to attract recruits for years.</p> <p>The issue is exacerbated by the fact that only 23% of young people meet the military&rsquo;s requirements, with many ineligible due to medical issues including obesity, drug use and criminal records.<strong></strong></p> <p>Nevertheless, chief of staff of the US Army, General James McConville, insisted the Army remains committed to <em>&ldquo;maintaining our standards, investing in America&rsquo;s youth, and emphasizing quality over quantity."</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>‘Hidden’ sanctions on Russian exports should be lifted, agriculture minister says</strong></p> <p>The deal that unblocked Ukrainian grain exports is not enough to help poor nations put food on the table, Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev said in an interview with RBC news, published on Monday.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>As part of this deal, about 4.6 million tons of agro-industrial products were exported from Ukrainian ports. The main product, a little less than half, was corn, about 1.2 million tons was wheat. Of course, this cannot cover the needs of starving countries, including the need for grain. In fact, it is merely a variation in the global market,</em>&rdquo; the minister stated. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Viktoria Abramchenko recently said that, according to estimations, the global grain market is about 800 million tons.</p> <p>Patrushev also noted that the main recipients of Ukrainian grain are European states, which &ldquo;<em>are not countries that really need it</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p>The official explained that Russian agricultural products could make a difference, but there are still restraints, which need to be overcome.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>&ldquo;<em>There are still barriers that continue to hold back our exports. If we call things by their proper names &ndash; these are hidden sanctions on the transportation of [Russian] products&hellip; Primarily, it is the limited availability of ships. International logistics companies prefer not to work with our exporters,</em>&rdquo; the minister explained. He also noted, however, that the problems are being worked out with exporters, and Russian companies which have their own fleet have fewer problems in that area.</p> <p>According to Patrushev, since the beginning of the agricultural year which started on July 1, Russia has already delivered about 8.3 million tons of grain to foreign markets, &ldquo;<em>and the growth rate of exports is increasing every day.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;This season we see an opportunity to supply no less, and maybe even more than 50 million tons of grain to the world market. In the second half of 2022 we will be able to export up to 30 million tons. This is exactly the volume that we promised within the framework of our agreements with the UN to solve the problem of world hunger,</em>&rdquo; the minister said.</p> <p><strong>For more stories on economy &amp; finance visit <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RT's business section</a></strong></p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The head of the ruling party has claimed that Russia critic Radoslaw Sikorski is helping Moscow’s cause against the US </strong></p> <p></p> <p>The leader of Poland&rsquo;s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), Jaroslaw Kaczynski, has mocked former Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, a senior opposition figure, claiming that despite his vocal criticisms of Russia, his actions are actually aiding Moscow, local media reports.</p> <p>Kaczynski took aim at Sikorski on Sunday during a public meeting with supporters in the northwestern city of Stargard. The conservative politician blasted a now-deleted tweet that Sikorski posted last week in response to the apparent sabotage of Russia&rsquo;s Nord Stream pipelines. Sikorski posted a photo of the site of the incident with the message: <em>&ldquo;Thank you, USA.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>The PiS leader told the audience that Russia&rsquo;s representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, used Sikorski&rsquo;s tweet to attack Washington during Friday&rsquo;s session of the UN Security Council.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;[Sikorski] could not have done a better thing [for Russia]&rdquo;</em> Kaczynski said, as cited by Polish media. <em>&ldquo;Why did he do that? I don&rsquo;t know, but I know that he did.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>He dismissed remarks made by former Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who Sikorski served under as foreign minister. Tusk described the tweet as a gesture of unnecessary <em>&ldquo;extravagance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Kaczynski said that a diplomat would be considered &lsquo;extravagant&rsquo; if he were to come to a reception in his underpants, but what Sikorski did went beyond this, drawing laughter from the audience.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>The issue came up again during the meeting, when a journalist asked Kaczynski about US claims that since 2014, Russia spent around $300 million on influencing politicians in other nations. He joked that he does not believe Sikorski <em>&ldquo;was worth that much,&rdquo;</em> but suggested that digging into his potential ties with Russia could be worthwhile.</p> <p>Other senior PiS members also criticized Sikorski&rsquo;s tweet. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki accused him of aiding Russia, saying the ex-foreign minister destroyed his <em>&ldquo;myth as a diplomat.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;An elementary sense of the nation&rsquo;s interests is the duty of every Polish politician and every Polish political party,&rdquo;</em> he said in a Facebook post on Saturday.</p> <p>Accusing political opponents of cozying up with Russia is a long-held tradition in Poland, and it works both ways.

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Moscow will consult with residents of Kherson and Zaporozhye, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said</strong></p> <p>Moscow has yet to determine the future borders of Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, which are set to be incorporated into Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told journalists.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;We will continue to consult with the residents of those regions on the issue of borders,&rdquo;</em> the official said on Monday.</p> <p>The two former Ukrainian regions voted last month to break away from Kiev and request being accepted into Russia. However, parts of them are still controlled by Ukrainian troops.</p> <p>The issue of borders came up last week, when President Vladimir Putin signed orders recognizing the two regions&rsquo; independence. The documents did not include any reference to the demarcation of the territories. When asked by journalists for clarification, Peskov promised to give an answer later.</p> <p>Further complicating the situation is the fact that Russian forces are in control of a small chunk of Ukraine&rsquo;s Nikolaev Region, which borders Kherson Region. Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Kherson administration, claimed last week that the land would be incorporated into Russia.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>This week, the Russian parliament is scheduled to ratify the unification treaties with the two regions, as well as the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics.</p> <p>The latter two territories, which were recognized as independent by Russia in February, are defined <em>&ldquo;by the 2014 borders,&rdquo;</em> according to Peskov.</p> <p>Russian troops and Donbass militias have since seized much of the disputed land, but not all of it.</p> <p>Kiev blasted the referendums that paved the way for the accession as a <em>&ldquo;sham&rdquo;</em> and reiterated its intention to defeat Russia on the battlefield and oust its troops from all land that it claims as Ukrainian. Moscow said the ballots were a legitimate exercise of the right to self-determination.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>This October marks a significant anniversary for a music genre that has traversed a difficult path</strong></p> <p>The history of Russian jazz began 100 years ago. While it has forged a unique path, the art form that evolved in the country has deep connections to that which&nbsp;thrived around the world. However, the path of this &lsquo;bourgeois art&rsquo; was not easy in the Soviet Union, and it survived persecution only thanks to the musicians who were its faithful adherents.</p> <p>In&nbsp;October 1922, the Russian musician, poet and choreographer Valentin Parnakh performed in Moscow for the first time with his ensemble called 'First Eccentric Orchestra of the Russian Federated Socialist Republic &ndash; Valentin Parnakh's Jazz Band'.</p> <p>Parnakh had heard the music in Paris and became so fascinated that he purchased a set of the required instruments and brought them to the Soviet Union. His first &ndash; and&nbsp;subsequent &ndash; performances were great successes, especially among artists from the avant-garde. The concerts also inspired other musicians to try&nbsp;out the new genre.</p> <p>Four years later, in 1926, Soviet audiences had the chance to&nbsp;encounter authentic jazz. American pianist Sam Wooding and his orchestra visited the country together with the Chocolate Kiddies show and performed in Moscow and Leningrad (the Soviet-era name of St. Petersburg). <em>&ldquo;[It was] the first country I&rsquo;d ever been in where I was considered a human being,&rdquo;</em> woodwind multi-instrumentalist Garvin Bushell, who performed with Wooding, recalled later.</p> <figure> <img src="https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.10/original/6338873385f54001e70144cc.jpg" /> <figcaption> Sam Wooding's jazz band on a roof garden in Berlin – probably April 1930. <span class = "copyright"> ©&nbsp; ullstein bild via Getty Images </span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>Several images from those performances can be seen in the silent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVfPWKSHBIo">film</a>&nbsp;'A Sixth Part of the World' directed by Soviet cinema pioneer Dziga Vertov. The episodes are featured in the part where the director condemns slavery and capitalism.</p> <p>The same year, the ensemble of Frank Withers, together with saxophonist, clarinetist&nbsp;and the world&rsquo;s first jazz soloist Sidney Bechet, also toured the USSR.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <h2>Jazz pioneers</h2> <p>It was a time&nbsp;of cultural exchange. In 1926, the Soviet agency tasked with promoting education and culture sent musician Leopold Teplitsky to the US to study local music. He worked in the orchestra of Paul Whiteman, often called the King of Jazz. They were the first to perform George Gershwin&rsquo;s 'Rhapsody in Blue'.</p> <p>Back home a year later, Teplitsky founded the 'First Concert Jazz Band' in Leningrad. The group, which performed in concert halls typically designed for classical music, was a great success.</p> <p>Leonid Utyosov called&nbsp;Teplitsky <em>"the first of the domestic musicians who showed&nbsp;the&nbsp;playing of jazz."</em> Utyosov himself was the main jazz star of the USSR in the late '20s and '30s. Having assembled the band 'Thea-Jazz' (a portmanteau of Theatrical Jazz), he created a&nbsp;popular musical trend that acquired the scale of a theatrical performance.</p> <p>In 1934, Utyosov and famous actress Lyubov Orlova starred in the first Soviet musical comedy featuring a jazz musician as a main character and a soundtrack with plenty of jazz compositions. 'Jolly Fellows', with tunes&nbsp;composed by Isaak Dunayevsky, became a sensation, and was Joseph Stalin&rsquo;s favorite movie.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/z0Xj1mI9f6Q" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p>The film&nbsp;was even released in&nbsp;the US under the name 'Moscow Laughs<em>'.</em>&nbsp;Legend has it that even&nbsp;Charlie Chaplin offered his praise of the film.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Before this film, Americans knew Dostoevsky&rsquo;s Russia, now they have seen a big shift in the public psychology. People there are laughing loudly and cheerfully. This is a great victory. It is more persuasive than bullets and speeches,"</em> he is believed to have written.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <h2>&lsquo;Unbending of saxophones&rsquo;</h2> <p>However, jazz was nevertheless a controversial phenomenon in the USSR. In spite of the success of Utyosov and others, many perceived the genre as a manifestation of bourgeois culture&nbsp;that was inappropriate for a socialist state.</p> <p>In 1928,&nbsp;renowned Soviet writer Maxim Gorky published an article called 'About the Music of the Fat,'&nbsp;in which he blasted the new music genre as something belonging to &ldquo;<em>fat</em>&rdquo; capitalists who have no clue about real culture.</p> <p>During the Second World War, however, jazz orchestras performed for soldiers right near the battlefield,&nbsp;although some of those forays&nbsp;ended tragically. For example, in 1941,&nbsp;the State Jazz Orchestra of the USSR was performing near the frontline when the musicians&nbsp;were surrounded by the enemy and most of them ended up being killed.</p> <p>Utyosov, whose military songs are now considered classics,&nbsp;also performed&nbsp;concerts during the war. His&nbsp;music (which included more than just jazz) was in the Soviet mainstream until the mid-60s, and he himself became one of the immortal legends of the Soviet stage.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FTnF9n5of_s" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p>However, not all&nbsp;performers were&nbsp;so lucky. In 1930, Teplitsky was accused of espionage and jailed for three years. He was not the only jazz musician to have been persecuted. In fact, a lot of musicians were arrested and jailed in the '30 and '40s, although not necessarily because of their musical careers.</p> <p>With the beginning of the Cold War, the ideological battle against &lsquo;Western values&rsquo; intensified, and jazz became one of the targets. What became known as a time of the&nbsp;&lsquo;unbending of saxophones&rsquo; spawned phrases&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Today he&rsquo;s playing jazz,&nbsp;tomorrow he&rsquo;ll betray his Motherland&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one step from saxophone to a knife&rdquo;</em> (the latter one attributed to the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev). Thus, the art form remained&nbsp;repressed until the mid-50s.</p> <h2>Back to the stage</h2> <p>However, the years of the ban were unable to erase jazz from the Soviet cultural landscape. In 1956, the jazz orchestra of Oleg Lundstrem, which&nbsp;had not been allowed to&nbsp;be based in Moscow, finally got a chance to&nbsp;relocate to the capital. It should be noted that in 1994, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_Book_of_Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> recognized the Lundstrem&nbsp;ensemble as the oldest continuously existing jazz band in the world.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KC1rwBB5V0Q" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p>Jazz was given a new push&nbsp;in 1957, when Moscow hosted the World Festival of Youth and Students. This was a&nbsp;time of&nbsp;renewed cultural exchange, which inspired a whole new generation of musicians.</p> <p>How could it survive&nbsp;the years of oppression? According to Igor Butman, a legendary saxophone virtuoso and head of the Moscow Jazz Orchestra, we should thank the enthusiasts themselves.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Musicians just had a belief: They believed in their art, in their talent, in the improvisation, they couldn&rsquo;t live without their music.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em>&ldquo;Jazz is a universal language: People can talk to each other, because they know certain styles, they know the music. A jazz musician is quite dangerous for ideology &ndash; what if he decides to play something not featured in the score, some kind of call?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;he&nbsp;told RT.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to Butman, officials soon realized that there were challenges far more dangerous,&nbsp;such as rock music. So, jazz was&nbsp;rehabilitated to serve&nbsp;as something of a counterweight. Jazz clubs started to emerge in different cities of the USSR, and American jazz stars such as Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington arrived to tour the country.</p> <figure> <img src="https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.10/original/633886dd85f54005ea140fb9.jpg" /> <figcaption> <span class = "copyright"> ©&nbsp; vk.com / moscowjazzfestival </span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>Naming all the jazz musicians who became legends of the Soviet stage would be a daunting task. Georgy Garanian, Nikolay Levinovsky, Igor Bril, Alexey Kozlov &ndash; these are just a few of the names,&nbsp;but there are many more.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;In the USSR, there was always political pressure on jazz musicians &ndash; the ideology changed from allowing [perfomances] to denying [them], from support to oppression,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Butman explains.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>After the USSR collapsed, jazz received a strong impetus for development, as musicians could travel, study and perform in international ensembles. The ideological effect vanished, the state started to support jazz, so now we see new stars emerging.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In modern Russia,&nbsp;Butman is without a doubt the number one&nbsp;jazz personality. He has performed with ​​Chick Corea, Grover Washington Jr., Natalie Cole and many other global stars. Last year, Wynton Marsalis and Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra performed together with Butman and the Moscow Jazz Orchestra in Moscow.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/axaL_L2TTZQ" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p>Butman also&nbsp;plays a key role in promoting Russian jazz. Music festivals organized by him are held all across the country every year, which he and the musicians from his orchestra headline. He also supports up-and-coming talent by participating&nbsp;on the jury of jazz contests and heading up the Jazz Academy in Moscow.</p> <h2>Rich tradition</h2> <p>Is there anything in particular that distinguishes Russian jazz? According to Oleg Akkuratov, a virtuoso pianist and soloist with the&nbsp;Moscow Jazz Orchestra,&nbsp;the country's style&nbsp;is influenced by Russian culture and derives&nbsp;a lot from&nbsp;this rich tradition.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;You can find a lot of features of Russian traditional music in it,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;he told RT.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Playing jazz, you can do almost anything: You can include parts of classical music or cite well-known Soviet songs. That&rsquo;s why jazz can be understood &hellip; by almost everyone in our country.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em></em></p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CE512mrUVVs" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p>During his career, the 32-year-old musician has performed with opera singer Montserrat Caballe and participated in a concert at the residence of the Pope with the UNESCO choir. In 2018, he took second place at the prestigious Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition in the US.</p> <p>While touring, Akkuratov adds a unique touch to his performances &ndash; he sings in the language of the country where he&rsquo;s performing. The same goes&nbsp;for various Russian regions that have their own traditional languages.&nbsp;</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0TnnbEOok1I" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p>Foreign languages are helpful in understanding other cultures and the roots of their folk music, he says. Common features can be found everywhere, no matter&nbsp;which country's music you are listening to.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><em>&ldquo;You can listen to a jazz standard, and suddenly discover a part or an intonation that reminds you of a Russian folk song,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>Akkuratov&nbsp;says.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not because somebody is copying someone else. It&rsquo;s because music culture is universal.&rdquo;</em></p> <h2>Russian jazz as a world phenomenon</h2> <p>Even the current tense relations with the West are not able to halt the cultural exchange that the art form&nbsp;makes possible. The Moscow Jazz Festival, held this summer in the Russian capital, brought together musicians from countries such as Serbia, Brazil, T&uuml;rkiye, and India.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;No culture is a stranger to jazz,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Butman, who helped organize the event, says.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sometimes a matter of stereotype, to think that jazz belongs to one particular culture. There are brilliant Turkish musicians, Indian musicians, for example, Ravi Shankar, who&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrBSaijdAf0"><em>performed</em></a><em>&nbsp;with the Beatles and John Coltrane. And&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnyw_qG3CFI"><em>one</em></a><em>&nbsp;of the most distinguished jazz pianists in the world, Joey Alexander, is from Indonesia.</em></p> <blockquote> <p><em>Russian jazz is for sure a&nbsp;global phenomenon.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em>&ldquo;Look at the success of our musicians on the world stage. We see it now, and in ten years, we will see even more. Young people want to play jazz, they are not afraid of becoming jazz musicians.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>The Moscow Jazz Festival was just one of many events held across Russia this year to celebrate the 100th anniversary. On October 1, a stunning concert was held on the main stage of the iconic Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.</p> <figure> <img src="https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.10/original/633ab84085f5405ed67e8ffb.jpg" /> <figcaption> FILE PHOTO.

As for predictions, we will have to wait and see!</p> <p>Akkuratov believes that the musical landscape is changing so fast that it&rsquo;s hard to say for sure.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;For now, I&rsquo;m very happy that we have such a massive celebration of the 100th anniversary of Russian jazz. It&rsquo;s great that we are doing so much to promote our art in the country and abroad.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Alexandra Trusova has parted ways with respected trainer Eteri Tutberidze</strong></p> <p>Russian figure skater Alexandra Trusova has triggered debate in her homeland after it was revealed she is changing her coaching team, moving from the revered camp of Eteri Tutberidze to a group trained by Svetlana Sokolovskaya.</p> <p>Reports appeared at the weekend that Trusova, who won silver at the Beijing Winter Olympics in February, is making the move despite already unveiling routines developed with Tutberidze for the new season.</p> <p>Trusova, 18, will leave Tutberidze&rsquo;s camp based at the Khrustalny complex in southern Moscow, moving across the Russian capital to train with Sokolovskaya&rsquo;s team at CSKA.</p> <p>There, Trusova will join up with 19-year-old Russian men&rsquo;s star Mark Kondratiuk, with whom she is in a romantic relationship.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The recently introduced plan sparked a public outcry and, along with the new ‘mini-budget’, sent the pound to an all-time low</strong></p> <p>The UK government will drop its plan to cut the tax rate for the highest earners, which was the least popular measure in the newly announced &lsquo;mini-budget&rsquo;, following a public backlash and market upheaval. The move was announced on Monday by Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>It is clear that the abolition of the 45% tax rate has become a distraction from our overriding mission to tackle the challenges facing our economy. As a result, I&rsquo;m announcing we are not proceeding with the abolition of the 45% tax rate. We get it, and we have listened,</em>&rdquo; Kwarteng said in a statement.</p> <p>The new UK government, led by Prime Minister Liz Truss, announced a package of tax cuts and investment incentives dubbed the &lsquo;mini-budget&rsquo; on September 23. However, the measures were poorly received by Truss&rsquo; own Conservative Party, the public, and the financial markets. The package was to be funded by government borrowing, but neither Truss nor Kwarteng explained how it would be done.</p> <p>Part of the plan was to lower the top rate of tax paid on incomes over &pound;150,000 ($166,770) from 45% to 40%. It quickly became the least popular of the measures amid the cost-of-living crisis raging in the country.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>A number of senior lawmakers publicly denounced the policy, saying that cutting government spending and increasing borrowing to fund tax cuts for the wealthy would be politically risky.</p> <p>Following the mini-budget announcement, the UK pound sterling dropped to an all-time low and UK government bonds started to sell off at a historic rate. The Bank of England had to step in with a &pound;65 billion ($73 billion) temporary purchase program to calm the markets.</p> <p>The pound jumped on Monday morning after reports of the tax cut reversal first appeared. It lost some of the gains after the news was confirmed, but still traded up 0.6% at $1.123 at 08:40 GMT.</p> <p><strong>For more stories on economy &amp; finance visit <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RT's business section</a></strong></p> <p></p> ]]>

Johnson stepped down after officials in his cabinet resigned en masse due to disagreements over economic recovery policies and several controversies, such as the flouting of Covid-19 quarantine rules by senior government members, including Johnson himself.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Berlin’s envoy to the military bloc clarifies that NATO won’t actively fight for a non-member state</strong></p> <p>Germany&rsquo;s permanent representative to NATO has explained that the US-led bloc is not obliged to offer direct military assistance to Ukraine. Ruediger Koenig added that its members want to avoid a major war.</p> <p>He was speaking to Dein Spiegel, the youth version of Der Spiegel magazine, which published the interview on Saturday.</p> <p></p> <p>The Ukraine conflict dominated much of the article, with Koenig describing Russia&rsquo;s decision to launch its offensive against its neighbor in late February as a watershed event.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>We had peace, and now we see all of a sudden that one country is attacking another one just like that, in Europe,</em>&rdquo; the official said, adding that no one could have imagined anything like that.</p> <p>Germany&rsquo;s representative to NATO stressed that the military alliance as a whole, however, has no legal obligation to help Kiev repel Moscow&rsquo;s attack as Ukraine is not a member state. This means that Article 5 of NATO&rsquo;s treaty cannot be activated, the official explained. Under it, an attack on one ally is considered to be an attack against the whole of NATO, with all member states having to stick up for the targeted nation.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>According to Koenig, the military bloc is anxious to avoid getting actively involved in the conflict at all costs because &ldquo;<em>this would mean a very big war.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p>Such a scenario, which would see 30 more nations join the fray, is something &ldquo;<em>nobody wants,</em>&rdquo; the diplomat noted.</p> <p>When asked what can be done to help Ukraine, the envoy explained that individual member states are providing Kiev with weapons and money. Koenig went on to cite EU sanctions imposed on Russia over the past six months.</p> <p>He concluded that the prospect of peace is rather slim as Ukraine and Russia&rsquo;s positions seem to be irreconcilable. Koenig clarified that Ukraine &ldquo;<em>rightly</em>&rdquo; demands that Moscow cede all former Ukrainian regions in the south and east of the country that recently voted to join Russia, as well as Crimea, which joined the country in 2014. The official pointed out that the Kremlin, however, is unlikely to agree to such terms.</p> <p>Dein Spiegel is a media that offers &ldquo;<em>exciting, understandably written stories</em>&rdquo; for children who &ldquo;<em>want to understand the world,</em>&rdquo; according to a description on its website. The magazine is published monthly.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The football legend didn’t make it off the bench against Manchester City</strong></p> <p>Manchester United head coach Erik ten Hag claimed that he left Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench in a 6-3 defeat to crosstown rivals Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday <em>&ldquo;out of respect for his big career.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Ronaldo was again overlooked by the Dutchman for one of the Red Devils&rsquo; biggest matches of the season so far.</p> <p>With 10 Champions League titles between them, the Portuguese and former Real Madrid teammate Casemiro were made to watch from the sidelines as their team fell 4-0 behind when Erling Haaland and Phil Foden scored two goals each.</p> <p>The two youngsters completed their hat-tricks in the second half, but United pulled two goals back through Antony and Anthony Martial.</p> <p>Ronaldo wasn&rsquo;t afforded a cameo, however, and was evidently frustrated at being snubbed for the match that finished 6-3 as Martial netted a 91st-minute penalty.</p> <p>Asked why he had overlooked his star player in a post-match interview, the Dutch manager said Ronaldo didn&rsquo;t play any part in the loss <em>&ldquo;out of respect for his big career.&rdquo;</em></p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Erik ten Hag refused to bring on Cristiano Ronaldo in the Manchester derby &#39;out of respect for his career&#39; 👀<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MUFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MUFC</a> <a href="https://t.co/wdvGxbdIaV">pic.twitter.com/wdvGxbdIaV</a></p>&mdash; Match of the Day (@BBCMOTD) <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCMOTD/status/1576662266711244802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Ten Hag didn&rsquo;t expand any further, but added: <em>&ldquo;And the other thing was the advantage I could bring Martial. He needs the minutes but I don't want to point it out like that.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Giving Ronaldo the cold shoulder did not impress retired club legend and Sky Sports pundit Roy Keane, who suggested that Ten Hag and United should have sold the five-time Ballon d&rsquo;Or winner in the summer when he handed in a transfer request if the plan was to freeze him out.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;I think the manager is holding on to him &ndash; okay, you say you need options, but you don&rsquo;t hold on to Ronaldo to sit on the bench. He&rsquo;s one of the greatest players ever,&rdquo;</em> Keane said.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;He had options &ndash; this idea that he&rsquo;d no options is rubbish, he did have options, four or five very good options.</em></p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;𝙈𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙐𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙬𝙣 𝙣𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙗𝙪𝙩 𝙙𝙞𝙨𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙍𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡𝙙𝙤!&quot; 😤<br><br>Roy Keane believes Man United should have let Cristiano Ronaldo leave the club in the summer. <a href="https://t.co/Zgs4vlItPG">pic.twitter.com/Zgs4vlItPG</a></p>&mdash; Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1576641415479697408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p><em>&ldquo;Okay, today the manager, he brought [Anthony] Martial on and he scored two, so yeah, that&rsquo;s justified.

He&rsquo;s played in one or two European games,&rdquo;</em> Keane added.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just going to get uglier as the season goes on. Okay, Ronaldo&rsquo;s motivated with the World Cup coming up, but if he&rsquo;s sitting on the bench week in, week out, it&rsquo;s not good, it&rsquo;s just going to get ugly.</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;I think United have shown nothing but disrespect to Ronaldo. They should have let him go when the opportunity came.</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;As I said, he did have options to go, I know that for a fact, and holding on to him to sit on the bench I think is ridiculous for a player of his stature.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The Tesla CEO has been teasing fans with the prospect of sexy humanoid robots for years</strong></p> <p>Tesla&rsquo;s prototype humanoid robots, which CEO Elon Musk showcased last week, may be sold in alternative versions that appeal to aficionados of Japanese culture, the billionaire suggested on Twitter.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Naturally, there will be a catgirl version of our Optimus robot,&rdquo;</em> Musk said of his new product.</p> <p>He was referring to nekomusume, a fictional cat-woman that has its origins in Japanese folklore. Catgirls rose to prominence in manga and anime in the 1970s, before wining fans around the world.</p> <p>Musk presented his machines as the future of unskilled labor at home and in factories during Tesla AI Day 2022 on Saturday. He said Optimus bots would come with a price tag of around $20,000 and would be <em>&ldquo;mind blowing&rdquo;</em> in five to ten years.</p> ]]>

In 2019, he touted a software update for Tesla cars as a <em>&ldquo;crucial step towards catgirls,&rdquo;</em> while a year later he held a poll on his Twitter page, asking whether he should make such a product. The options were <em>&ldquo;absolutely&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;of course.&rdquo;</em></p> <p></p> <p>The robot will eventually become part of human experience as sexual or romantic partners, Musk said during a conversation with TED&rsquo;s Chris Anderson in April, adding that <em>&ldquo;We could make a robot catgirl.&rdquo;</em></p> <p></p> <p>Reaction from fans to Musk&rsquo;s latest promise was enthusiastic, though a few pointed out that at least in some works of fiction creating autonomous robots, especially human-like and sexy, does not end well for humanity.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">Oooooh! 😅 <a href="https://t.co/LEXds1Ps86">pic.twitter.com/LEXds1Ps86</a></p>&mdash; Chris Bergin - NSF (@NASASpaceflight) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASASpaceflight/status/1576046468716105728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ rg reported on Sunday, citing a person familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Maritime pilots are skilled navigators who guide vessels in coastal waters and narrow channels, and when entering and leaving ports.</p> <p>The exception would allow companies to hire pilots for tankers carrying Russian oil, which is banned under the current sanctions that take effect from December.</p> <p>The news comes after the Danish Maritime Authority told the Financial Times last week that the inability to use pilots for ships sailing through the sometimes-treacherous straits between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea will lead to significant safety and environmental risks.</p> <p>The EU imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow in response to its military operation in Ukraine, which was launched in February. Brussels announced the eighth round of restrictions on Wednesday after referendums on joining Russia were organized in the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics (DPR and LPR), as well as two Russian-held territories in southern Ukraine.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The group of oil-producing nations will meet in person this week for the first time since March 2020</strong></p> <p>OPEC and allies are expected to cut production at a meeting scheduled for Wednesday, according to media reports.</p> <p>Banks such as JPMorgan Chase told Bloomberg that the organization needs to lower output by least 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to stabilize global oil prices. According to Reuters, however, the group may take a more aggressive approach and slash output by more than 1 million bpd.</p> <p>The upcoming meeting at the OPEC headquarters in Vienna will be the first in-person gathering of the group since March 2020, and market experts say OPEC+ would not have ventured to convene in-person unless a large cut was on the table.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>I suspect that they might not want to go in person for a minor move&hellip; We certainly see a significant chance that the producer group will opt for a substantial cut to try to signal that there is indeed an effective circuit breaker in the market</em>,&rdquo; Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Analysts say the group&rsquo;s expected move to cut production is long overdue and would support the volatile oil market. International benchmark Brent oil dropped to a little over $85 per barrel this week, down from around $125 per barrel in February, when Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine. US West Texas Intermediate fell below $80 per barrel, settling at $79.74 per barrel at the end of trading on Friday. Industry experts are concerned that prices may drop further due to the general slowing of the global economy amid the tightening of monetary policy by key central banks and the recession threat.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>&ldquo;<em>Price swings have become the norm as market players juggle worries over the global economy and the prospect of tightening oil supplies,</em>&rdquo; Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM told Reuters.</p> <p>A production cut, if it happens, would come mere weeks before the EU sanctions on Russian oil exports come into effect on December 5, which, according to analysts, might complicate matters for OPEC. A member of OPEC+, Russia is currently shipping about 820,000 barrels of crude a day to Europe alone, according to Bloomberg. However, these volumes will be in jeopardy in two months, as the EU embargo targets Russia&rsquo;s seaborne oil shipments, as well as insurance and other services to tankers carrying Russian crude, even those not headed to Europe. While Russia has been quite successfully redirecting its crude exports in recent months, the EU embargo may pose problems for further efforts on this front.</p> <p><strong>For more stories on economy &amp; finance visit <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RT's business section</a></strong></p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Taipei’s de-facto ambassador calls for “strategic collaboration”</strong></p> <p>Taiwan&rsquo;s representative to India, Baushuan Ger, has praised the country as a protector of democracy that always stands up for justice, peace, and stability &ndash; and touted the <em>&ldquo;gargantuan untapped well&rdquo;</em> of mutually beneficial deals if New Delhi recognizes the island <em>&ldquo;in its own right.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;We need to join hands to fend off the expansion of autocracy,&rdquo;</em> because India <em>&ldquo;is just like Taiwan, standing at the forefront in the face of aggressive and belligerent authoritarian regimes,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Ger, the&nbsp;head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in India, said in an <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-taiwan-need-to-join-hands-to-fend-off-expansion-of-autocracy-taiwanese-envoy/article65962151.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with PTI on Sunday.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;It is my sincere hope that India sees Taiwan in its own right,&rdquo;</em> Ger said, insisting that <em>&ldquo;closer collaboration between the two is not only desirable but necessary.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;We can and should collaborate more on cyber, space, maritime, green energy, food security and even tourism and gastronomy,&rdquo;</em> he explained, while alluding to the growing popularity of yoga and Bollywood movies in Taiwan as signs of cultural affinity.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi has no official diplomatic relations with Taipei, but like&nbsp;many countries, has a special body to promote informal interactions and business relations, the India-Taipei Association (ITA).&nbsp;Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, when China&rsquo;s nationalist government fled to the island following its defeat in the civil war. Only a handful of nations, mostly microstates, officially recognize it as an independent entity.</p> <p>While not openly calling on India to immediately abandon the One-China policy, Ger claimed that Beijing has misled the world into misinterpreting UNGA Resolution 2758, which recognized the People&rsquo;s Republic of China as <em>&ldquo;the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Beijing has repeatedly warned that the principle of acknowledging the mainland&rsquo;s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan is a red line in China&rsquo;s relations with other countries that no one is allowed to cross. Following a provocative visit to the island by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the third most senior official in the US government, China pledged to <em>&ldquo;take necessary and resolute countermeasures.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>After Beijing conducted a series of large-scale military drills in areas around Taiwan, Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that New Delhi was <em>&ldquo;concerned&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;urged the exercise of restraint, avoidance of unilateral actions to change status quo, de-escalation of tensions and efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;India&rsquo;s relevant policies are well-known and consistent. They do not require reiteration,&rdquo;</em> he added, reaffirming but not directly mentioning the One-China principle.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The election authority has announced that neither candidate secured a majority in Sunday’s election</strong></p> <p>Following the first round of Brazil&rsquo;s presidential election on Sunday, it was announced that none of the candidates were able to secure a majority. A runoff between former President Lula da Silva and incumbent Jair Bolsonaro will take place on October 30.</p> <p>While a total of 11 candidates were vying for the top job in South America&rsquo;s powerhouse, only two&nbsp;have enjoyed&nbsp;significant&nbsp;support.</p> <p>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 76, who served as president from 2003 to 2010, received 48.1% of the vote; the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, 67, received 43.5%. With 98.8% of the votes tallied, it was mathematically impossible for&nbsp;either of them to win in the first round, according to the election authority.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;As I always said, we are going to win these elections &ndash; this is just extra time for us,&rdquo;</em> Lula <a href="https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/443492-ganar-elecciones-lula-campa%C3%B1a-bolsonaro-brasil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>,&nbsp;speaking from a hotel in downtown Sao Paulo on Sunday night.<em> &ldquo;The&nbsp;battle continues until our final victory.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Lula da Silva, who represents Brazil&rsquo;s Workers&rsquo; Party, has focused his campaign on overcoming social inequality and alleviating poverty. Among the measures he proposes are raising taxes on the rich, widening the social safety net, and increasing the minimum wage.</p> <p>Bolsonaro&rsquo;s campaign slogan has been &lsquo;God, family, homeland, and liberty&rsquo;. His vision of Brazil&rsquo;s future includes privatizing the country&rsquo;s state-owned oil company, opening the Amazon region to more mining, and easing gun regulations. Ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s vote, Bolsonaro warned that he will contest the results if he loses, calling into question the reliability of Brazil&rsquo;s electronic voting system.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>David Petraeus predicted that NATO would 'take out' Moscow's forces in retaliation</strong></p> <p>Retired US Army General David Petraeus has predicted that Washington would lead a devastating response to any Russian nuclear attack in Ukraine, wiping out all of Moscow&rsquo;s forces and military bases in the region.</p> <p>Patraeus, who briefly served as the CIA director&nbsp;after his&nbsp;counterinsurgency strategy failed in Afghanistan,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h--3wTmLSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a>&nbsp;an ABC News interview on Sunday <em>&ldquo;We would respond by leading a NATO, a collective effort, that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p> <p>The retired general&nbsp;did not offer any specifics on how NATO forces would make easy work of the Russian military, and admitted he was speaking hypothetically and was not aware of the Biden Administration's plans. Patraeus added that Washington should avoid a <em>&ldquo;nuclear-for-nuclear&rdquo;</em> exchange, <em>&ldquo;but you have to show that this cannot be accepted in any way.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>In such a scenario, the US would be going to war directly with the world&rsquo;s largest nuclear power, as President Vladimir Putin warned last month that Moscow would use all available means to protect Russia and its people if the country&rsquo;s territorial integrity is in danger. The White House interpreted it as a threat to use nukes against Ukraine, and responded by threatening <em>&ldquo;catastrophic consequences.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>The retired general claimed that last week&rsquo;s referendums in the Donbass republics and the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, which declared independence and&nbsp;voted overwhelmingly to join Russia, were a <em>&ldquo;desperate&rdquo;</em> move by Putin amid losses on the battlefield.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;He is losing, and the battlefield reality he faces is, I think, irreversible,&rdquo;</em> Petraeus said. He added there was <em>&ldquo;no amount of shambolic mobilization, which is the only way to describe it, no amount of annexation, no amount of even veiled nuclear threats, can actually get him out of this particular situation.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Petraeus' predictions follow similarly bold comments last month by retired US Army General Ben Hodges, who oversaw US forces in Europe from 2014 to 2018. Hodges also claimed that Washington could respond to a nuclear strike against Ukraine by wiping out Russian bases in Crimea or destroying Moscow&rsquo;s Black Sea Fleet.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at the time that Moscow will use any weapons it sees fit to use in order to defend its people. Without naming names, Medvedev cautioned that <em>&ldquo;retired idiots with generals&rsquo; stripes&rdquo;</em> should not attempt to intimidate Moscow by claiming that NATO could attack Crimea.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Hypersonic [missiles] are sure to hit targets in Europe and the US much faster,&rdquo;</em> Medvedev warned, adding that <em>&ldquo;the Western establishment and NATO citizens need to understand that Russia has chosen its own path&rdquo;</em> and there is <em>&ldquo;no way back.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Petraeus said Putin is trying to intimidate European nations into dropping their support for Ukraine. <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to out-suffer Europe. Europe&rsquo;s going to have a tough winter&hellip; but they&rsquo;ll get through it, and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll crack on the issue of support for Ukraine.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Petraeus commanded US forces in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011, presiding over America&rsquo;s highest death tolls&nbsp;during&nbsp;the 20-year war and increased civilian casualties. The general helped persuade then-President Barack Obama to deploy an additional 30,000 US troops to the country, but his counterinsurgency plan, which hinged on <em>&ldquo;securing and serving&rdquo;</em> the local population, flopped. He then became CIA director in 2011, only to resign the following year after having an extramarital affair with the woman who was writing his biography.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>An STD outbreak in Europe has led to calls for a British adult film stars’ union</strong></p> <p>A syphilis outbreak in Europe may finally convince UK porn stars to unite&nbsp;&ndash; professionally speaking& ]]>
  <![CDATA[ nbsp;&ndash; as fear of catching the bug due to the industry's lax safety standards has convinced some to stop work altogether, porn actress-turned-sex educator Lianne Young told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/porn-syphilis-outbreak-fears-union-stis-b2177230.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Independent</a> this week.&nbsp;</p> <p>Young spoke to eight adult film performers who had walked off the job due to concerns about syphilis, she said, pointing out that they were &ldquo;<em>losing a lot of money&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;and would be better able to make their concerns felt if they negotiated as a collective. &ldquo;<em>People have been asking for a union for a couple of years now</em>,&rdquo;&nbsp;she said. She added that she had been in contact with Alana Evans, president of US union the Adult Performance Artists Guild, about setting up something similar in the UK.</p> <p>A union could help protect professional actors from sloppy testing requirements for sexually transmitted diseases. American and EU porn stars get tested weekly, or &ldquo;<em>at worst every 14 days</em>,&rdquo; while UK actors are responsible for testing themselves once every 28 days. A union could also protect them from non-professional actors who refuse to miss out on a big payday just because they&rsquo;re infected.</p> <p>While it&rsquo;s unclear how widespread the latter phenomenon actually is, Young insisted it &ldquo;<em>absolutely worries</em>&rdquo; her, noting that &ldquo;<em>it can spread very fast.</em>&rdquo;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>&ldquo;<em>Porn stars are real human beings</em>,&rdquo; she told the Independent, declaring &ldquo;<em>there needs to be a union to be a bridge to connect up with Public Health England and the police</em>.&rdquo; She has been in touch with that agency regarding outbreak reports, but as foreign organizations have found, reporting doesn't go far enough.</p> <p>PASS, a database of sexual health certificates for porn stars working in the US, was &ldquo;<em>informed of multiple positive syphilis tests</em>&rdquo; among European stars, but it has been unable to do anything about it beyond posting a warning to global industry resource Xbiz last week. STD testing in Europe is &ldquo;<em>not standardized,</em>&rdquo; and PASS does not officially operate on the continent, so there is no way for the organization to &ldquo;<em>know the full extent of the exposures or additional cases,</em>&rdquo; or to impose a production hold if an actor was found to be infected.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, a porn stars&rsquo; union isn&rsquo;t a guarantee against STD outbreaks, as the US Centers for Disease Control last month revealed that syphilis cases jumped 26% last year.</p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The group said it could target foreign oil companies in response to “economic war”</strong></p> <p>As efforts to extend a six-month ceasefire between Yemen&rsquo;s Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led military coalition failed, the Houthis warned that they could launch attacks on oil companies in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>The United Nations confirmed on Sunday that negotiations between the Houthis and the Saudi coalition had broken down, and that a ceasefire set to expire the same day would not be extended. The fragile truce had been in place since April, and saw fighting cease for the longest time since the outbreak of civil war in Yemen in 2014.</p> <p>UN envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg called on both sides to avoid resuming hostilities and <em>&ldquo;pursue every avenue for peace.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>In a statement a day earlier, the Houthis condemned the Saudi coalition for failing to improve the humanitarian situation in the country. Already the Arab world&rsquo;s poorest nation, Yemen has been under blockade by the coalition since 2015, triggering widespread humanitarian crisis. While the Houthis accused the Saudis of limiting the influx of&nbsp;vital supplies during the ceasefire, Yemen&rsquo;s Saudi-allied government accused the Houthis of blockading&nbsp;key road corridors inside Yemen.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2-the armed forces give oil companies operating in the UAE and Saudi Arabia an opportunity to organize their situation and leave.<br>forewarned is forearmed</p>&mdash; Yahya Sare&#39;e (@Yahya_Saree) <a href="https://twitter.com/Yahya_Saree/status/1576627619348754432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>The Saudi-led coalition countries, the Houthis said, have <em>&ldquo;transfer[red] the war to the economic field,&rdquo;</em> as oil companies continue <em>&ldquo;looting&rdquo;</em> the country&rsquo;s natural resources during the blockade.&nbsp;The rebel group called on foreign oil firms, particularly from Saudi Arabia and the UAE to cease activities and stop extraction in Yemen as of Sunday.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Lloyd Austin has said China is trying to establish a “new normal” around Taipei, but he doesn’t expect a near-term attack</strong></p> <p>US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has downplayed the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, saying he sees no imminent attack on the self-governing island despite escalating tensions in the region.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see an imminent invasion,&rdquo;</em> Austin said in a CNN interview that aired on Sunday. <em>&ldquo;What we do see is China moving to establish what we would call a new normal, increased activity. We saw a number of center line crossings of the Taiwan Strait by their aircraft. That number has increased over time. We've seen more activity with their surface vessels and waters in and around Taiwan.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Beijing ramped up military drills in the area and cut off military and climate ties with Washington after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August. Chinese officials condemned the trip, saying it undermined Beijing&rsquo;s sovereignty over Taiwan and emboldened separatists in Taipei. China has vowed to regain control over Taiwan, by force if necessary.</p> ]]>

He scolded Russian President Vladimir Putin for suggesting that such weaponry could be used if Moscow&rsquo;s sovereign territory were threatened, saying <em>&ldquo;nuclear saber-rattling is not the kind of thing we&rsquo;d expect to hear from leaders of large countries with capability.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>CNN host Fareed Zakaria suggested that since Moscow is declaring four former Ukrainian regions in the Donbass its own, Kiev&rsquo;s US-supplied weapons are already capable of striking areas that Putin considers to be sovereign Russian territory. He asked whether the Pentagon is therefore more inclined to provide the longer-range weaponry that Ukraine has requested.</p> <p>Austin dismissed any link between Russia&rsquo;s accession of new regions and US aid plans, saying that Washington would never respect the public referendums by the regions that voted to join Russia.

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The top US health official profited handsomely amid the pandemic, financial disclosures appear to show</strong></p> <p>US chief medical officer Anthony Fauci&rsquo;s net worth surged to $12.6 million in 2021, nearly twice the $7.6 million it had been in 2019, watchdog group OpenTheBooks revealed on Friday, citing financial disclosures it obtained from Fauci&rsquo;s employer, the National Institutes of Health.</p> <p>Already the highest-paid employee in the federal government before the pandemic as director of the National Institutes for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Fauci pulled down a salary of $456,000 in 2021 and $480,000 in 2022. However, that paycheck represents just a fraction of the money he made while his Covid-19 policies helped push the US economy into a recession.&nbsp;</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.openthebooks.com/assets/1/6/Fauci_Documents.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disclosures</a> show multiple trusts, retirement accounts, and other financial assets, all of which seem to have appreciated in value during the pandemic even as much of the real economy suffered. Book royalties and the $1 million Dan David Prize from Israel, as well as appearances and speaking fees, round out Fauci&rsquo;s Covid-19 windfall. When OpenTheBooks asked the NIH to see all royalties paid to the doctor, however, the document they received &ndash; which would have shown exactly how much Fauci was financially benefiting from drugs and other patents &ndash; was reportedly heavily redacted.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>&ldquo;<em>While Dr. Fauci has been a government bureaucrat for more than 55 years, his household net worth skyrocketed during the pandemic</em>,&rdquo; OpenTheBooks CEO Adam Andrzejewski told Fox News, attributing the doctor's wealth spurt to &ldquo;<em>career-end salary spiking, lucrative cash prizes awarded by nonprofit organizations around the world, and an ever-larger investment portfolio</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p>Fauci has been criticized throughout the pandemic for allegedly profiting off the pricey antiviral medication remdesivir, which he proclaimed the standard for treating Covid-19 despite lackluster clinical trial results and having been against the initial advice of the World Health Organization.</p> <p>Fauci appears to dislike discussing his finances in public, having been caught on a hot mic describing Republican Senator Roger Marshall as a &ldquo;<em>moron</em>&rdquo; for merely asking to see what were supposed to be publicly available documents. The Kansas senator, who is also a doctor, asked to see Fauci&rsquo;s financials during a January hearing only for the NIAID chief to insist they were already public &ndash; a statement that was not true at the time. OpenTheBooks sued for access in January and only recently received the documents it posted on Friday.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>It's pretty easy to see who benefited from the destruction of the infrastructure, and it's not state energy giant Gazprom</strong></p> <p>Several days on from news of the explosions, details surrounding the deliberate sabotage of the two Nord Stream pipelines remain opaque and uncertain, although the Western media is certain of one thing &ndash;&nbsp;Moscow&nbsp;itself is to blame.</p> <p>That's right, writers and editors either believe, or are pretending to believe, that&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;blew up infrastructure that it poured billions of dollars into building. The same country they routinely, and falsely, smear as a "<em>mafia state</em>."&nbsp;</p> <p>One wonders have they paused to ponder what sort of crime syndicate would destroy one of its chief revenue streams? Especially&nbsp;after spending over&nbsp;&euro;23 billion on building the infrastructure, according to Gazprom's own statements.&nbsp;</p> <p>That would, of course, require self-awareness. But there's little time for that when they have propaganda to push.&nbsp;</p> <p>Moscow, as it happens, believes the truth lies elsewhere.&nbsp;As President Vladimir Putin said&nbsp;on Friday, <em>&ldquo;those who benefit are responsible, of&nbsp;course,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>alluding to the involvement of what he called the "Anglo-Saxons." A Russian turn of phrase which basically means the US and its allies, led by Britain.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Who really&nbsp;blew up Nord Stream?</h2> <p>On the crucial question of why Moscow would deliberately destroy a gas pipeline into which it had invested billions&nbsp;to construct over several years, and which was a valuable source of income &ndash; by some estimates the natural gas still stored therein alone was worth up to &euro;800 million &ndash; Western journalists remain at a total loss.</p> <p>Several media outlets have accordingly published <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/09/27/putins-nord-stream-2-sabotage-sends-warning-will-blow-pipes/">lengthy articles</a> speculating on the Kremlin&rsquo;s motives for doing so. But there has inevitably not been a single comparable investigation of the reasons why Russia wouldn&rsquo;t do so, of which there are clearly a great many. There has also been no probe of the numerous actors with far more obvious motives, far more to gain by doing so, and the&nbsp;capability&nbsp;to implement such a plan.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is despite several pro-Western sources actively praising the sabotage. For example, Radoslaw Sikorski, a European Parliament member and former Polish foreign minister, took to Twitter in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/former-polish-foreign-minister-thanks-us-for-damaging-nord-stream-pipeline/2696530">immediate aftermath</a> and posted a photo of the environmentally destructive gas leak&nbsp;that resulted from the damage. His message was stark:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Thank you, USA.&rdquo;</em> Mysteriously, the post has since been deleted. Perhaps somebody has a word.&nbsp;</p> <figure> <img src="https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.10/original/63384a8585f54001e70144aa.jpg" /> <figcaption> Screenshot <span class = "copyright"> ©&nbsp; Twitter / @Dpol_un </span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>Of course, the explosions occurred just before Poland and Norway opened an alternative pipeline running through Denmark that brings in gas from the North Sea rather than from Russia.&nbsp;</p> <p>Moscow's&nbsp;Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia claimed at a UN Security Council meeting on Friday that the Nord Stream pipeline leak is "<em>beneficial</em>" to the United States. He stated that American suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) "<em>should celebrate</em>" as the European Union moves away from Russian gas.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Nebenzia added that <em>"it makes no sense for us to destroy the project with our own hands"</em> and stressed Russia must be part of any investigation into the matter, along with the likes of Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. <em>"If someone thinks that it is possible to conduct an investigation without Russia's participation, we have reasons to doubt the objectivity of this investigation,"</em> he said at the Security Council.</p> <h2>&lsquo;Hi-tech crewless vehicles&rsquo;</h2> <p>There has also been zero acknowledgement that an attack on Nord Stream had long been a <a href="https://vz.ru/society/2021/4/14/1094528.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major concern</a> for Gazprom&rsquo;s executives, and Russian officials. While Moscow&rsquo;s proposals to equip Nord Stream 2 with security measures, such as early warning systems, were framed as the Kremlin insidiously seeking to extend its military and intelligence infrastructure across Europe, fears of precisely what has come to pass turned out to be well founded.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/6296977">In November 2015</a>, a few kilometers east of the Baltic island of &Ouml;land and near where the pipeline runs,&nbsp;an armed remote-controlled mine disposal vehicle was found&nbsp;during an annual routine check of the structure. It was removed by the Swedish Armed Forces, but it has never been revealed how the explosive-packed vehicle ended up adjacent to Nord Stream, or when, why, who or what was operating it.</p> <figure> <img src="https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.10/original/633846a320302734be71a68a.jpg" /> <figcaption> FILE PHOTO: A Nord Stream 2 employee stands at the pig receiving station for the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea pipeline in the gas landing facility. <span class = "copyright"> ©&nbsp; Jens Büttner / picture alliance via Getty Images </span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>It&rsquo;s a matter of record, though, that the US &ndash; which <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1574777710257360897">for decades</a> aggressively opposed, both&nbsp;covertly and overtly, Western European projects to receive Russian energy &ndash; is a world leader in underwater drone innovation.

Indeed, in the early 1980s, the agency hatched a <a href="https://www.risidata.com/Database/Detail/cia-trojan-causes-siberian-gas-pipeline-explosion">devilish plan</a> whereby Soviet agents were allowed to acquire control software from a Canadian company that was&nbsp;embedded with a Trojan horse virus.</p> <p>This was used to run pumps, turbines, and valves on the Trans-Siberian gas pipeline. In June 1982, the CIA used the Trojan horse to disrupt a routine pressure test by changing pump speeds and valve settings to double the usual amount of pressure released, at a level far in excess of what pipe joints and welds could withstand.&nbsp;</p> <figure> <img src="https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.10/original/633846da85f54006c70cc4c9.jpg" /> <figcaption> FILE PHOTO: Welding and assembly of pipes at the construction of the Urengoi-Uzhgorod gas pipeline. <span class = "copyright"> ©&nbsp; Sputnik / Vladimir Rodionov </span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>This produced an explosion with the power of a three-kiloton nuclear weapon, significantly disrupted gas supplies to and from the Soviet Union, damaged Moscow&rsquo;s overseas earnings and caused disruption to its domestic economy.

Why this information was neither publicized at the time, nor prompted Berlin to undertake security measures to prevent such an event, is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not been confirmed whether the CIA identified&nbsp;in its warnings which state or non-state actor was the potential or likely future culprit, and the agency&nbsp;&ndash; typically so quick to blame Russia for any and all malfeasance at home and abroad&nbsp;&ndash; has remained eerily silent since the explosions took place.&nbsp;</p> <p>US officials have also been uncharacteristically reticent to attribute blame to Russia, or indeed any party. A White House spokesperson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/27/world/russia-ukraine-war-news">simply stated</a>&nbsp;on September 27 that: <em>&ldquo;Our partners are investigating this, so we stand ready to provide support to their efforts once they have completed their investigation.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>And the last thing that&nbsp;bears remembering is a comment made by President Joe Biden&nbsp;in early&nbsp;February, when he declared that if Russia invaded Ukraine, <em>&ldquo;there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2&rdquo;</em> as <em>&ldquo;we will bring an end to it.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>When asked how the US would be able to do that since the project was co-owned by Germany, Biden responded: <em>&ldquo;I promise you, we will be able to do that.&rdquo;</em></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Britain has been fighting its largest ever outbreak of bird flu, and cases continue to rise</strong></p> <p>The largest outbreak of bird flu in UK history might affect the supply of turkeys and could jeopardize traditional Christmas celebrations, the National Farmers&rsquo; Union (NFU) has said. The warning came as the government has reported more than 150 cases of the disease across the country in less than a year.</p> <p>In an interview with Sky News, James Mottershead, chairman of the NFU Poultry Board, claimed that if avian influenza gets into turkeys, it could cause &ldquo;<em>holy carnage.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>That could cause real supply chain issues in the run-up to Christmas time,</em>&rdquo; Mottershead said.</p> <p>He explained that if a farm is designated as an infected premise, it can be &ldquo;<em>out of production</em>&rdquo; for up to a year.</p> <p>The official&rsquo;s warning came the day after the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) ordered the &ldquo;<em>humane</em>&rdquo; culling of tens of thousands of turkeys, geese, ducks and chickens in Norfolk and Suffolk. This was due to the discovery of several cases of bird flu at three local farms.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Late last month, Dr. Christine Middlemiss, the UK&rsquo;s chief veterinary officer, said in a statement that <em>&ldquo;a growing number of bird flu cases on commercial farms and in backyard birds</em>&rdquo; has been driven by <em>&ldquo;high levels of disease within wild birds.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>She stressed that while taking biosecurity measures and maintaining high hygiene standards are paramount to prevent outbreaks, the number of cases is expected to rise over the coming months due to the return of migratory birds to the UK.&nbsp;</p> <p>The risk to human health remains &ldquo;<em>very low,</em>&rdquo; according to DEFRA.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The half-kilometer-across celestial body does not pose an immediate danger to the planet, however</strong></p> <p>Russian scientists have discovered a new massive asteroid heading towards earth, the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics said on Sunday. Images of the celestial body, which measures around half a kilometer in diameter, were shared on social media.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;On the night of October 1, two observatories in southern Russia confirmed the discovery of a new asteroid 2022 SE37 approaching Earth,&rdquo;</em> the institute said in a statement.</p> <p>The asteroid orbits the Sun on an elliptical trajectory, making a full circle in some 3.44 years, it added. The object does not, however, pose an &ldquo;<em>immediate danger</em>&rdquo; to our planet, the scientists stated.</p> <p>The institute released early imagery of the asteroid, which appears as nothing more than a distant dot in the skies through powerful telescopes.</p> <script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?19" data-telegram-post="kiam_ison_network/94" data-width="100%"></script> <p>Reached by TASS for comment, an astronomer with the Russian Academy of Science, Yuri Balega, said that 2022 SE37 was unlikely to ever threaten Earth.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;This is yet another of almost 30,000 asteroids already discovered by astronomers around the world. It is flying at a distance of many millions of kilometers from our planet and poses no danger to Earth,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>A whistleblower has alleged that crew members of the USS Nimitz were led to drink contaminated water and denied medical help</strong></p> <p>A US Navy whistleblower has reportedly accused his superiors on the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier of lying to crew members about the severity of a fuel leak into their drinking water and denying them medical treatment when they were sickened by the contaminated fluid.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;We were exposed to an unhealthy amount of JP-5,&rdquo;</em> a sailor on the carrier told Business Insider, referring to a common type of kerosene-based jet fuel. The media outlet, which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-jet-fuel-traces-uss-nimitz-sailor-says-worse-problem-2022-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted its article</a> on Saturday, said it didn&rsquo;t identify the sailor out of concern that he might face retribution from the Navy for speaking out.</p> <p>The incident occurred in mid-September, when members of the nearly 3,000-person crew noticed discoloration and a foul smell in the water that they use for drinking and showering. After initially advising the crew to drink only bottled water, the ship&rsquo;s commanding officer and executive officer later announced that the Nimitz&rsquo;s normal water supply was safe to use.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>&ldquo;<em>People believed the CO and the XO, and people were showering in this stuff</em>,&rdquo; the whistleblower said. The next day, the officers reversed course again, saying the water was unsafe. However, crew members who sought medical attention after suffering such symptoms as nausea and skin rashes were allegedly turned away.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Medical was telling us that it will pass through,&rdquo;</em> the sailor said. He added that when the ship&rsquo;s water tanks were opened for inspection on September 17, two days after the discoloration and bad odor were first noticed, there was a <em>&ldquo;thick layer of JP-5 on top of the potable water.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>For at least the following ten days, sailors were told to test the water&rsquo;s taste and smell, the whistleblower said. A photo provided by the sailor showed a glass container of water with a thick green layer on the top and a murky white layer on the bottom, according to Business Insider.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><em>&ldquo;The health and well-being of our sailors is our top priority,&rdquo;</em> Navy spokesman Commander Sean Robertson told the media outlet. He acknowledged that ten&nbsp;crew members had reported health issues that <em>&ldquo;could be associated with JP-5 ingestion.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>The Navy has said that its tests detected only <em>&ldquo;traces&rdquo;</em> of jet fuel in the water. The USS Nimitz has been docked in San Diego since September 17, rather than going back out to sea last week as scheduled. The same carrier was forced back to the docks last November because of a <em>&ldquo;deficiency&rdquo;</em> in its nuclear propulsion plant.</p> <p>Four families near Hawaii&rsquo;s Pearl Harbor sued the Navy in August for leaks of jet fuel into their water supply. The plaintiffs said the Navy initially denied their concerns, even as the fuel tainted the water supply used by about 93,000 people, then refused them proper medical care.</p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Referring to the impending inclusion of four former Ukrainian regions into the Russian Federation, the leaders said that they would &ldquo;<em>never</em>&rdquo; recognize &ldquo;<em>Russian attempts to annex any Ukrainian territory</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p>Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, commenting on Zelensky&rsquo;s NATO bid, emphasized that &ldquo;<em>any decision on membership has to be taken by consensus</em>&rdquo; of all&nbsp;30 members. Stressing that NATO &ldquo;<em>has an open door policy,</em>&rdquo; Stoltenberg said that currently the top priority of the bloc is &ldquo;<em>to support Ukraine,</em>&rdquo; both militarily and financially. He believes that this is also<em> &ldquo;the best way to respond&rdquo;</em> to Russia&rsquo;s actions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stoltenberg&rsquo;s remarks echoed a statement made earlier by the White House. Speaking on Friday, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan claimed that the best way now is to provide Ukraine with &ldquo;<em>practical</em>&rdquo; support, while &ldquo;<em>the process in Brussels should be taken up at a different time.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna, meanwhile, revealed on Sunday that Kiev&rsquo;s NATO application <em>&ldquo;is already on its way to Brussels.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Zelensky&rsquo;s announcement of the NATO membership bid came on the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin signed treaties on the inclusion of two Donbass republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, into Russia. Moscow, which considers the enlargement of NATO a direct threat to its national interests, cited Ukraine&rsquo;s potential membership in the alliance as one of the reasons for its military offensive.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The pontiff has called on Kiev and Moscow to declare an immediate ceasefire and negotiate</strong></p> <p>Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, should declare a truce and return to the negotiating table, Pope Francis said in an appeal to the two leaders on Sunday. He warned that further escalation could lead to the deployment of nuclear weapons, with catastrophic consequences.</p> <p>According to the translated transcript published by Vatican News, the Pope described the Ukraine conflict as a <em>&ldquo;terrible and inconceivable wound to humanity,&rdquo;</em> to which there is no apparent end in sight.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Certain actions can never be justified, never,&rdquo;</em> he went on, stopping short, however, of pointing the finger of blame at either side directly.</p> <p>Arguing that <em>&ldquo;war is never a solution,&rdquo;</em> Pope Francis called for an <em>&ldquo;immediate ceasefire&rdquo;</em> and urged the warring sides to negotiate <em>&ldquo;solutions that are not imposed by force, but consensual, just and stable.&rdquo;</em> He also emphasized the importance of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country, as well as the rights of minorities.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>According to the Pope, the continuation of the conflict could lead to a <em>&ldquo;nuclear escalation&rdquo;</em> which would likely inflict catastrophic consequences not only on the parties involved, but the whole world.</p> <p>Addressing Putin, Pope Francis urged him to <em>&ldquo;stop this spiral of violence and death,&rdquo;</em> while calling on the Ukrainian president to <em>&ldquo;be open to serious proposals for peace.&rdquo;</em> He also asked that other countries do what they can to bring an end to the war, without allowing themselves to be dragged into the conflict.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Pope&rsquo;s appeal came days after Zelensky posted a message on Telegram on Friday, saying that Kiev will not negotiate with Moscow as long as Putin remains in power. The comment came on the day that the Russian president signed treaties paving the way for the inclusion of the two Donbass republics and two former Ukrainian regions into the Russian Federation, following referendums in which the people in these regions voted overwhelmingly in favor of splitting from Kiev and joining Russia in late September. Ukraine and its Western backers dismissed the referendums as a <em>&ldquo;sham&rdquo;</em> and slammed Moscow for what they called a violation of Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Mayor Eric Adams’ plans have faced opposition from local officials</strong></p> <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is negotiating a deal to house illegal immigrants aboard a massive cruise ship docked at Staten Island. With Texas busing thousands of illegals to the Big Apple, Republican officials in the city called Adams&rsquo; plan <em>&ldquo;ludicrous&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;incompetent.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Norwegian Cruise Line told Fox News on Saturday that the city had inquired about chartering one of its vessels to house the migrants. The company, which operates 18 megaships, said that talks are ongoing, and that <em>&ldquo;no agreement has been reached.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>News of Adams&rsquo; plan was first broken by the&nbsp;<a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/30/adams-close-to-deal-for-norwegian-cruise-ship-full-of-migrants-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> on Friday, with the newspaper reporting that the Democrat mayor is also considering erecting a similar tent city to one already under construction in the Bronx, and hiring another cruise ship operated by the Estonian company Tallink.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>While it is unclear how much hiring either ship will cost, the Post said that officials estimate the Norwegian liner will be <em>&ldquo;cheaper&rdquo;</em> than the tent city, which is slated to cost the city&rsquo;s taxpayers $15 million per month.</p> <p>Around 15,500 migrants have arrived in New York since May, according to figures from City Hall. With illegal crossings from Mexico at a record high, Republican governors have taken to helping these migrants travel north to Democrat-run states, in a bid to highlight the consequences of the Biden administration&rsquo;s lax border policy.</p> <p>While Florida Governor Ron DeSantis flew immigrants to the wealthy elite enclave of<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/562962-marthas-vineyard-migrants-desantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard</a> last month, Texas&rsquo; Greg Abbott and Arizona&rsquo;s Doug Ducey have been sending busloads of border-jumpers to New York and Washington since early summer.</p> <p>Adams intends to moor the chartered cruise ship on Staten Island. However, Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella, A Republican, told the Post that he considers the plan <em>&ldquo;problematic.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s next? RVs on the street? These problems should not become Staten Island&rsquo;s problem,&rdquo;</em> he said. US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, also a Republican, described the plan as <em>&ldquo;a ludicrous idea that could only come out of an incompetent administration.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;Both Biden and Adams refuse to address the root of the problem and, instead, continue to incentivize illegal immigration,&rdquo;</em> she said. <em>&ldquo;Democrats have abdicated their responsibility but when Republicans take the House we will put an end to this nonsense.&rdquo;</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Officials reportedly documented thousands of daily migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border in September</strong></p> <p>More illegal immigrants than ever are pouring into the US via its border with Mexico, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security, cited by the Washington Free Beacon this week. <br /><br />The documents appear to show that last month was the worst September in history for migrant crossings. Between 7,300 and 7,500 migrants crossed the border every day during the month, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).&nbsp;</p> <p>The preliminary numbers from the CBP indicate between 219,000 and 225,000 migrants crossed the border from Mexico in September, according to the Washington Free Beacon. Either figure would break last year&rsquo;s standing record of 192,000 illegal crossings.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>These record-breaking numbers we're seeing at the border have become the new normal</em>,&rdquo; a senior DHS official told the Washington Free Beacon on Friday, questioning how much further the situation would be allowed to deteriorate before action was taken.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>The entirety of 2022 has been a record-breaking year for illegal immigration. By mid-August, the number of undocumented arrivals had surpassed two million, according to Fox News, a significant increase over last year&rsquo;s 1.7 million.</p> <p>This year also set records for illegal drug trafficking across the US-Mexico border, with over 12,000 pounds of fentanyl &ndash; the opioid driving the country&rsquo;s overdose epidemic &ndash; seized by the CBP, according to a memo circulating in the Senate. Largely due to the rise of fentanyl in the US&rsquo; drug supply, overdoses have become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. This has brought the country&rsquo;s average life expectancy down to its lowest point since 1996.</p> <p>The Biden administration has come under fire for its perceived failure to secure the southern border. The president&rsquo;s reversal of Trump-era policies aimed at curtailing unchecked immigration has seen border crossings surge under his watch, spiking from 72,000 in December 2020, Trump&rsquo;s last month in office, to 173,000 in March 2021.&nbsp;</p> <p>The presidents of Guatemala and El Salvador have laid the blame for their citizens streaming across the Mexican border at the US president&rsquo;s feet.</p> <p>The White House has attempted to revise its public stance on illegal immigration as Americans grow increasingly alarmed with the flood of new arrivals. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Guatemala to tell those preparing to make the voyage &ldquo;<em>don&rsquo;t come</em>&rdquo; after avoiding the border for over a year since being named responsible for it.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>However, the administration&rsquo;s policies continue to send mixed messages. Rather than address the grievances of Republican governors who condemn dumping buses and planes full of illegals in their states, Biden&rsquo;s team has accused them of crimes against humanity for shipping the migrants to Democrat-run cities instead. The administration was even found to be funding legal aid for immigrants fighting deportation, according to a Fox News investigation.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Admiral Tony Radakin claimed Russia could attack the West’s satellites</strong></p> <p>Moscow could use space-based weaponry to target Western infrastructure, the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Tony Radakin told the Telegraph on Friday.</p> <p>Radakin, who took up his post last year, sees Russia as a long-term threat to Britain.</p> <p>Russia <em>&ldquo;has capabilities in space,&rdquo;</em> Radakin&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/09/30/russia-could-carry-attacks-space-warns-british-armed-forces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. <em>&ldquo;We saw an example of that at the tail end of last year, when Russia exploded an object in space which created immense debris. Russia has nuclear capabilities, Russia has underwater capabilities.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Radakin was referring to Russia&rsquo;s test last year of an anti-satellite missile, which saw a ground-launched missile take out an old Soviet reconnaissance satellite. The US accused Russia of <em>&ldquo;weaponizing space&rdquo;</em> and creating a cloud of debris, although the US tested its own anti-satellite missiles with similar results over a decade ago. India and China have also trialed such weapons.</p> <p>The admirals&rsquo; mention of Russia&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;underwater capabilities&rdquo;</em> came after a series of explosions crippled the Russia-Germany Nord Stream gas pipelines last week. While some in the West have blamed Russia for targeting its own infrastructure, Moscow has called these accusations <em>&ldquo;stupid,&rdquo;</em> with President Vladimir Putin blaming the attack on <em>&ldquo;the Anglo-Saxons,&rdquo;</em> a Russian colloquialism for the US-UK transatlantic alliance.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told The Telegraph that he could also envision a Russian attack on satellite systems, which could cripple the West&rsquo;s communications infrastructure.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Russia could also attack the GPS systems which play a key role, both military and civilian, throughout the world,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;There could be some disruption to civilian services, such as sat-nav systems used in most of our phones and cars.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Such a move, Radakin said, would trigger a response from NATO, but one likely short of direct military intervention.</p> <p>Russia has given no indication that it intends to fight the West in space. However, Radakin has given similar warnings before. Russia has <em>&ldquo;cyber capabilities, it&rsquo;s got space capabilities, and it&rsquo;s got particular programmes under water so it can threaten the underwater cables that allow the world&rsquo;s information to transit around the whole globe,&rdquo;</em> he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/559135-uk-threat-radakin-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a> in July.</p> <p>Radakin&rsquo;s warnings, both in July and on Friday, were accompanied with calls for the UK to increase its military spending.</p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Washington is subsidizing Kiev on a monthly basis and expects the Europeans to do the same, sources say</strong></p> <p>The US is urging EU states to collectively match the $1.5 billion it's plowing into Ukraine every month, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.</p> <p>According to unnamed officials, the Biden administration <em>&ldquo;has pressed Europe to do more&rdquo;</em> in its efforts to back Ukraine&rsquo;s fight against Russia.</p> <p>One Bloomberg source said that the US and its allies, which have supplied Kiev with many standalone aid packages, have been mulling a more regular mechanism that would prevent Ukraine&rsquo;s battered economy from collapsing.</p> <p>According to another source, EU officials were warned that the US Congress would be increasingly speaking in favor of <em>&ldquo;more burden sharing&rdquo;</em> among allies. Another official noted that the US expects the EU to provide Ukraine with funding roughly equal to the monthly $1.5 billion Washington is ready to put on the table.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>The funds are said to be critical for covering Kiev&rsquo;s essential needs, such as basic public expenditures, as well as schools, hospitals and the electrical grid.</p> <p>In late April, the chief of the International Monetary Fund said that Ukraine needs $5 billion every month to keep its economy running. Meanwhile, the same month Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky named an even larger figure &ndash; $7 billion per month &ndash; adding that <em>&ldquo;hundreds of billions of dollars&rdquo;</em> would be required for the country&rsquo;s reconstruction.</p> <p>On Thursday, the US Senate approved another massive Ukraine aid package, which included $12 billion in additional economic and military aid, thus bringing the total amount of US assistance to Ukraine to about $54 billion since late February, when Russia launched its military operations.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the EU has paid out to Ukraine only &euro;1 billion ($980 million) of the &euro;9 billion it promised in May. In mid-September, Brussels also approved the release of another &euro;5 billion, but these funds have not been disbursed yet.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Around 10% of recruits have been driven into the military by the constant “nagging” of their spouses, the official said</strong></p> <p>One-tenth of the men in Russia volunteering for the conflict with Ukraine are doing so to escape their henpecking wives, the mayor of the coal-mining town of Vorkuta, Yaroslav Shaposhnikov, has claimed.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Around 10% of volunteers who go to the frontline are going there because their wives probably became accustomed to a decent life&hellip; and are nagging, nagging, and nagging,&rdquo;</em> Shaposhnikov said during an online panel discussion &ndash; &lsquo;Open Vorkuta&rsquo;.</p> <p>The official urged Russian women to provide a solid <em>&ldquo;rear&rdquo;</em> for their husbands and support them instead. Shaposhnikov, however, did not elaborate on what his 10% estimate was based on.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Video of the meeting was posted on social media by the mayor, which has gone viral and received wide media coverage. Amid waves of mockery, Shaposhnikov defended his remarks, saying his comments were taken out of context by the media.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;I am a patriot of my Motherland. I cannot objectively say how [the remark] looks from the outside. The words were taken out of context, and some even gave their own interpretation. You need to watch the full video, but in general, I stand my ground: A woman is the rear and support of a man, who she must back in any situation,&rdquo;</em> he told media outlet Podyem.</p> <p>Russia declared a partial mobilization earlier this month to bolster its military in the conflict with Ukraine, which broke out in late February. Currently, Moscow is seeking to mobilize 300,000 men, focusing on those who have served in the military and have previous combat experience.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Hollywood star Mark Hamill has been recruited to raise money for the Ukrainian military</strong></p> <p>Star Wars actor Mark Hamill has urged the world to help Ukraine acquire a bigger fleet of drones during its conflict with Russia.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Ukraine needs drones. They have some drones, but not nearly as many as the Russians,&rdquo;</em> the actor who played Luke Skywalker in the films told the BBC on Sunday.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hamill <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkHamill/status/1575568979069837312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> on Thursday that he had become an ambassador for United24, a platform set up by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to raise funds for the country&rsquo;s military. The actor is focusing on helping to bring in donations for the Army of Drones, a project aimed at assisting Kiev in procuring surveillance UAVs, according to its website.</p> <p>The actor tweeted that he was <em>&ldquo;honored&rdquo;</em> by his new role. In the Sunday interview, Hamill said that Zelensky, himself a former comedian and actor, made references to the space saga while discussing the conflict.</p> ]]>

Kherson Region and most of Zaporozhye have been under the control of&nbsp;the Russian military since March.&nbsp;</p> <p>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev&rsquo;s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and <em>&ldquo;create powerful armed forces.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The process would be time-consuming and costly, according to Russia’s deputy PM</strong></p> <p>Russia may be able to fix the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which were damaged earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak said on Sunday.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>There are technical possibilities to restore the infrastructure, it requires time and appropriate funds. I am sure that appropriate opportunities will be found,</em>&rdquo; Novak told Russia 1 TV.</p> <p>According to the official, however, the first step should be to determine who is behind the incident.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>As of today, we proceed from the fact that it is necessary, first of all, to figure out who did it, and we are sure that certain countries, which had expressed their positions before, were interested in it. Both the US and Ukraine, as well as Poland at one time said that this infrastructure is not going to work, that they will do everything to make sure of it, so, of course, it is necessary to seriously look into it</em>,&rdquo; Novak stated.</p> <p>Citing German security services, Der Tagesspiegel newspaper earlier reported that the damaged routes could be permanently out of use if they are not repaired quickly, as salt water could cause corrosion.</p> <p>The Danish authorities reported leaks on both the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines on Monday after a local pipeline operator noted a loss of pressure following a series of undersea explosions in the area. The Danish Energy Agency reported earlier on Sunday that the pressure on the Nord Stream 1 is stable and the gas leakage is over, while on Saturday, it said the Nord Stream 2 also stopped leaking gas.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Mail on Sunday discovered a US website listing the current contact details of nearly all British ministers</strong></p> <p>The personal mobile phone numbers of Prime Minister Liz Truss and 25 UK Cabinet ministers can be easily obtained on a US website that offers a subscription to its searchable database for just &pound;6.49 ($7.25) a week, Mail on Sunday has revealed.</p> <p></p> <p>The site, the name of which the newspaper chose not to disclose, claims to list more than 14 billion files with stolen data. Some of the cyberattacks go back more than a decade, according to the outlet. Besides the phone numbers of almost the entire UK Cabinet, the website reportedly offers their email addresses, passwords and other personal information.</p> <p>Before publishing the article, Mail on Sunday notified the government of the security breach. On Saturday, the ministers discussed the threat with national security advisers, according to the newspaper.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;The Government is aware that websites exist that aggregate details from historical data breaches, therefore much of the data on these websites is old and incorrect,&rdquo;</em> a Cabinet Office spokesman said, as quoted by the outlet.</p> ]]>

A Mail on Sunday reporter visited it on Friday &ndash; just to discover a &ldquo;<em>scruffy</em>&rdquo; office, used as a service address for &ldquo;<em>hundreds of companies</em>.&rdquo; A receptionist was unable to provide the journalist with any information about the people behind the database.</p> <p>The personal details of UK government members have reportedly been targeted by hackers on multiple occasions. As recently as this past April, according to The Telegraph, the Foreign Office launched an urgent investigation into how the private data of government employees had ended up on Russian social media sites.</p> <p>Last year, the Government Security Group criticized ministers for making themselves easy targets for cyberattacks and advised them to stop using WhatsApp and personal emails for business purposes.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Incumbent Jair Bolsonaro is crossing swords with ex-President Lula da Silva</strong></p> <p>Brazilians are casting their ballots to decide who will lead the country for the next four years, in what is described by the media as an increasingly bitter race.</p> <p>Vying for the top job in South America&rsquo;s powerhouse are 11 candidates. However, only two of them enjoy considerable support and are regarded as frontrunners: 67-year-old Jair Bolsonaro, who is seeking a second term, and 76-year-old Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who served as president from 2003 to 2010.</p> <p>As voting is mandatory in Brazil, more than 156 million citizens are expected to participate.</p> <p>According to two surveys released on Saturday by some of Brazil&rsquo;s most established pollsters, left-winger Lula da Silva is projected to receive over 50% of the vote, meaning he could win in the first round. If there is no clear winner, a second round will be held on October 30.</p> ]]>

Lula da Silva called the incumbent president a &ldquo;<em>liar.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p>A former army captain who went on to spend nearly three decades in Congress, Bolsonaro has already warned that he will contest the results if he loses, calling into question the reliability of Brazil&rsquo;s electronic voting system, which he says is susceptible to fraud &ndash; which the country&rsquo;s electoral authority vehemently denies.</p> <p>Lula da Silva has focused his campaign on overcoming social inequality and alleviating poverty. Among the measures he proposes are raising taxes on the rich, widening the social safety net, and increasing the minimum wage.</p> <p>Bolsonaro&rsquo;s campaign slogan has been &lsquo;God, family, homeland, and liberty&rsquo;. His vision of Brazil&rsquo;s future includes privatizing the country&rsquo;s state-owned oil company, opening the Amazon region to more mining, and easing gun regulations.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>There will also be less wind and rainfall – a setback for alternative power sources – a weather tracker says</strong></p> <p>European countries may be about to face a colder than usual winter, the head of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) predicted on Sunday. This forecast comes as the continent is struggling with an energy crunch spurred by the sanctions the West has slapped on Russia over the Ukraine conflict.</p> <p>Speaking to the Financial Times, ECMWF Director-General Florence Rabier said that early data suggest that in November and December Western Europe may face a period of high pressure. This, she noted, may bring in colder weather with less wind and rainfall, which may reduce the amount of power generated by renewable power sources.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>If we have this pattern then for the energy it is quite demanding because not only is it a bit colder but also you have less wind for wind power and less precipitation for hydro power,</em>&rdquo; Rabier told the outlet.</p> <p>The ECMWF chief went on to say that while in the short term Europe may experience milder weather due to the recent hurricanes in the Atlantic, an atmospheric phenomenon called La Nina may bring in colder weather later on. This usually occurs due to periodic cooling of the Pacific Ocean, which triggers ripple effects on weather across the globe and can change wind and precipitation patterns.</p> <p>Rabier noted that Europe just experienced one of its hottest summers in history. While this proved to be a bonanza for solar power, it also led to a decreased share of wind and hydro power in the EU&rsquo;s energy mix.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Various Western officials and public figures have warned of the desperate situation the EU may find itself in this winter. On Thursday, Microsoft founder Bill Gates claimed that in a few months the continent may face a &ldquo;<em>very scary situation</em>&rdquo; as many people could be unable to heat their homes.</p> <p>In late September, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson also predicted that this winter &ldquo;<em>will not be easy</em>,&rdquo; but adding that next winter &ldquo;<em>will be even more difficult</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p>In recent months, Brussels has been reeling from an energy crisis fueled by skyrocketing gas prices due to the sanctions the West imposed on Russia over the Ukraine conflict. To alleviate the situation, the EU approved on Friday a package of emergency measures, including mandatory power savings, a cap on excess market revenues, and a levy to capture surplus corporate profits. Officials have also encouraged consumers to save energy by all available means.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Antony Blinken named weapons shipments as Washington’s primary tool to achieve this goal</strong></p> <p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba that Washington would help Ukraine<em> &ldquo;regain control of its territory&rdquo;</em> by force if necessary. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has repeatedly stated that his goal is to seize all lands claimed by Russia, including Crimea.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;The United States will always honor Ukraine&rsquo;s internationally recognized borders and&hellip;will continue to support Ukraine&rsquo;s efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically,&rdquo;</em> Blinken told Kuleba on Saturday, according to a readout of the call provided by State Department spokesman Ned Price.</p> <p>US President Joe Biden issued the same statement verbatim on Friday, after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed accession agreements to start the process of bringing the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics, as well as the regions of Zaporozhye and Kherson, into the Russian Federation.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>However, neither Biden nor Blinken has announced any major change in US policy to help Ukraine retake these lands. The latter stated that US arms deliveries &ndash; including a $1.1 billion package announced earlier this week &ndash; would continue to flow as they have since February.</p> <p>Zelensky responded to Putin&rsquo;s move on Friday by declaring that he would never negotiate a peace settlement as long as the Russian president remains in power, and also by signing an application demanding <em>&ldquo;accelerated&rdquo;</em> admission to the NATO alliance. Zelensky&rsquo;s application was rebuffed by NATO and US leaders, however, with the White House declaring that Ukraine&rsquo;s potential membership in the alliance <em>&ldquo;should be taken up at a different time.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Zelensky has repeatedly declared that his forces would retake all Russian-held lands, including Crimea, which voted to join Russia in 2014, by <em>&ldquo;any means that we consider correct.&rdquo;</em> Still, according to Putin, once the Donbass republics and Zaporozhye and Kherson are formally incorporated into Russia, they would be defended with <em>&ldquo;all means available.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The audio service promoted falsehoods about Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, according to Roskomnadzor</strong></p> <p>Russia has blocked SoundCloud, one of the world&rsquo;s largest online audio distribution platforms, for spreading misinformation about Moscow&rsquo;s military campaign in Ukraine, the nation&rsquo;s media watchdog Roskomnadzor said in a statement on Sunday.</p> <p>Access to the service has been suspended at the request of the Prosecutor General&rsquo;s Office because SoundCloud was displaying &ldquo;<em>materials containing false information about the essence of [Russia&rsquo;s] special military operation in the territory of Ukraine</em>,&rdquo; according to the Roskomnadzor document, as cited by various outlets.</p> <p>In particular, this includes spreading falsehoods about the military campaign&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>form, methods of warfare (attacks on civilians, strikes on civilian infrastructure), as well as about numerous civilian casualties at the hands of Russian soldiers</em>,&rdquo; the regulator said.</p> <p>Roskomnadzor noted that, according to Russian legislation, such &ldquo;<em>fake information</em>&rdquo; is subject to being immediately blocked, adding that it had twice demanded that the platform&rsquo;s owner delete the objectionable materials.</p> <p>The watchdog added that &ldquo;<em>should the prohibited information be removed, the resource will be unblocked</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p>SoundCloud was blocked in Russia on Saturday, with Roskomnadzor saying at the time that the platform had violated Russia&rsquo;s data protection law. It also claimed that the service flouted regulations prohibiting &ldquo;<em>calls for massive civil unrest, extremist activities</em>&rdquo; while disseminating &ldquo;<em>false information of public importance</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p>In recent months, Russian authorities have imposed various restrictions and fines on a number of Western-based tech giants for failing to comply with local legislation. In March, the platforms Facebook and Instagram were banned in Russia as extremist organizations after they allowed online hate speech against the country&rsquo;s nationals.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>In late July, a Moscow court fined social media platforms Snapchat, Tinder, and WhatsApp for refusing to localize the data of Russian users in the country. The same punishment was imposed on American search giant Google after it failed to remove prohibited information on the Ukraine conflict.</p> <p>Prior to that, Spotify, another popular audio streaming service, withdrew from Russia, arguing that it had to do so due to the legislation that criminalizes knowingly publishing false information about the actions of Russia&rsquo;s armed forces.</p> <p>In early March, Russia adopted a law that allows the authorities to impose substantial fines on persons and entities for discrediting the Russian army or calling for sanctions against Moscow. If an offense leads to &ldquo;<em>grave consequences</em>,&rdquo; the perpetrator could face a prison sentence of up to 15 years.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Newcomers are allowed to claim privileges without a good reason to avoid deportation, the home secretary has said</strong></p> <p>The migrant crisis in Britain is &ldquo;<em>out of control</em>&rdquo; due to legal loopholes, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told local media on Saturday, vowing to &ldquo;<em>take dramatic action</em>&rdquo; to remedy the situation.</p> <p>Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, Braverman said, &ldquo;<em>there&rsquo;s a crisis on the [English] Channel and it&rsquo;s been going on for far too long</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>The problem has gone out of control for a variety of reasons,</em>&rdquo; she claimed, adding that one of the most notable reasons is the 2015 Modern Slavery Act, which was sponsored by former UK Prime Minister Theresa May.</p> <p>According to Braverman, this law has been actively abused by migrants seeking to stay in the country. &ldquo;<em>The aims and the structure of that legislation have been completely distorted</em>,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<em>majority of people coming here from Albania</em>&rdquo; claim to be &ldquo;<em>victims of modern slavery</em>,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>The minister went on to note that some migrants attempt to claim this status after they &ldquo;<em>may have paid tens of thousands of pounds for the privilege</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>That&rsquo;s also regardless of the fact that they will have actively sought to come to the UK through an illegal, illicit and dangerous method</em>,&rdquo; she added.</p> <p>Braverman says she intends to &ldquo;<em>take dramatic action</em>&rdquo; to reverse the tide, telling the outlet that she plans to amend the act to raise the evidential threshold in a way that allows privileges to be denied to those not entitled to them.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>She noted that even convicted criminals, including foreign pedophiles and murderers, are able to abuse the law to avoid being deported, saying: there is &ldquo;<em>a really low bar that you have to cross to be considered to be a victim of modern slavery.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p>The home secretary, who was appointed in early September, also claimed that some parts of the police have been &ldquo;<em>captured</em>&rdquo; by woke groups, echoing a previous statement in which she lashed out at law enforcement agencies for paying too much attention to &ldquo;<em>diversity and inclusion</em>&rdquo; rather than fighting crime.</p> <p>In recent years, Britain has been plagued by a migrant crisis, with thousands attempting to cross the English Channel in small boats.</p> <p>According to government figures, as of late September, more than 30,000 migrants have crossed the channel by boat this year, exceeding the total numbers for 2021.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Giorgia Meloni vows to fight soaring energy prices while putting her country’s interests first</strong></p> <p>Italy will make its own interests a top priority, Giorgia Meloni, who is expected to be the country&rsquo;s next prime minister, said in her first major speech on Saturday after last week&rsquo;s election victory.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;Italy&rsquo;s attitude must return to defending its national interests in order to find common solutions. And it is something that will change in the coming months,&rdquo;</em> Meloni, who leads the conservative Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, said in a speech in Milan.</p> <p><em>&ldquo;It does not mean having a negative attitude towards others, but a positive attitude to ourselves.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>Meloni stated that tackling soaring energy prices is one of her most pressing goals. <em>&ldquo;I am in constant contact with the outgoing government, which is engaged in a very complex negotiation to seek solutions at the European level,&rdquo;</em> she said.</p> <p>Italy is among the countries pushing for an EU-wide energy price cap, while Germany opposes such a measure.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Meloni also said that the Italian economy needs to be less reliant on outside suppliers. <em>&ldquo;We need a serious approach to the issue of supply chains. We have realized today that we depend on everyone for everything,&rdquo;</em> she said, adding that Italy and the EU should <em>&ldquo;rethink&rdquo;</em> their strategy on the matter.</p> <p></p> <p>Western media has compared Meloni to Italy&rsquo;s World War II-era fascist leader Benito Mussolini and highlighted that one of FdI&rsquo;s predecessors was a party with ties to Mussolini&rsquo;s government. Meloni, however, called such comparisons <em>&ldquo;nonsense.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;The Italian right has handed fascism over to history for decades now, unambiguously condemning the suppression of democracy and the ignominious anti-Jewish laws,&rdquo;</em> she said in a video address in August.</p> <p>The FdI, which received the most votes on September 25, is expected to form a coalition with the other right-wing parties, Matteo Salvini&rsquo;s League and Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s Forza Italia (Forward Italy).</p> <p>The snap election was called after Prime Minister Mario Draghi&rsquo;s cabinet collapsed due to disagreements over measures to fight inflation and Covid-19 recovery programs.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill offering protection to youths who are being denied gender-affirming care elsewhere</strong></p> <p>California will now welcome transgender minors and their families from other US states where local authorities have restricted access to gender-affirming therapy, according to new legislation signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>We believe that no one should be prosecuted or persecuted for getting the care they need &mdash; including gender-affirming care,</em>&rdquo; the official proclaimed in a statement shortly after signing the bill.</p> <p>The legislation, among other things, bans California healthcare providers from disclosing medical information in relation to other states&rsquo; laws prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors. On top of that, the new bill prohibits the enforcement of a court order &ldquo;<em>based on another state&rsquo;s law authorizing a child to be removed from their parent or guardian based on that parent or guardian allowing their child to receive gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care.</em>&rdquo;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>From now on, a court in California is also authorized to take temporary emergency jurisdiction when a child has not been able to receive gender-affirming health care elsewhere, which typically encompasses measures ranging from mere counseling all the way to hormone therapy that delays puberty for those who want to change their sex. Some on social media were quick to suggest that this effectively means that California courts will be able to take custody of trans children if they flee their home states. However, Asaf Orr from Transgender Youth Project told Reuters that &ldquo;<em>this law simply clarifies that courts should retain jurisdiction in situations where a parent brings their child to California so that they can obtain medical treatment for gender dysphoria.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p>State Senator Scott Wiener, the mastermind behind the bill, tweeted that the new piece of legislation aims to protect minors and their families &ldquo;<em>if they&rsquo;re being criminalized in their home states.</em>&rdquo; Wiener also criticized states &ldquo;<em>like Texas &amp; Alabama</em> [that] <em>are seeking to tear these families apart.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p>Back in February, Texas Governor Greg Abbott called on the state&rsquo;s Department of Family and Protective Services to probe any reported cases of minors receiving gender-affirming care. He also urged ordinary citizens to inform authorities of such suspected instances.</p> <p>In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey signed a bill that made providing gender-affirming medical care to people under the age of 19 a felony for medical professionals. However, the initiative faced opposition from a local court.</p> <p>A similar law was passed in Tennessee in May, making the treatment needed for a transition between genders off limits to prepubescent minors.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Moscow is flipping the bloc's script by moving to absorb Kiev's lost lands, thus switching the fight to its own turf</strong></p> <p>By infusing tens of billions of dollars&rsquo; worth of military aid into Ukraine, NATO produced a <em>&ldquo;game-changing&rdquo;</em> dynamic designed to throw Russia off balance. By undertaking the referendums in Kherson, Zaporozhye, Donetsk, and Lugansk, Russia changed the game altogether.</p> <p>The ancient Greeks spoke of <em>lemma</em> as representing a logical premise, a matter taken for granted. This contrasted with a <em>dilemma</em>, or <em>&ldquo;dual premise&rdquo;,</em> where one would be presented with an either/or proposition. The Romans furthered this notion, referring to a &ldquo;<em>double premise&rdquo;</em> as <em>argumentum cornutum</em>, of the &ldquo;<em>horned argument,&rdquo;</em> because by answering one argument, an individual would be impaled by the logic of the second. Thus are the ancient roots of the modern idiom, &ldquo;<em>on the horns of a dilemma.&rdquo;</em></p> <p>This is the ultimate objective of maneuver warfare, for example: to position your forces in such a manner as to present the enemy with no good option &ndash; should they react to one pressing threat, they would find themselves overwhelmed by the other.</p> <p>The Russian military operation that has been underway in Ukraine for more than seven months now has provided ample examples of the military forces of both sides being confronted with a situation that compelled them to alter their preferred course of action; the Russian <em>&ldquo;diversion&rdquo;</em> against Kiev early on in the SMO prevented the Ukrainians from reinforcing their forces in eastern Ukraine, and the recently concluded Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkov compelled a hasty Russian withdrawal from a significant swath of previously occupied Ukrainian territory.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Both examples cited presented one side with a <em>lemma</em>, or a single problem, which needed to be addressed. But neither was able to put&nbsp;its opponent &ldquo;<em>on the horns of a dilemma,&rdquo;</em> forcing a response which would result in impalement regardless of the option chosen. The reason for this is simple &ndash; very rarely will competent military commanders allow themselves to be presented with a military problem for which there is no viable response. War, it seems, is hard work, and dilemmas don&rsquo;t fall from trees.</p> <p>Or do they? Ever since Boris Johnston flew to Kiev in April to convince Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to pull out of peace talks then ongoing with Russia in the Turkish city of Istanbul, NATO has embarked on a program designed to provide Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military and financial assistance, including the transfer of modern heavy weapons and the use of facilities on Western&nbsp;soil where tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops could be trained and organized without fear of Russian intervention.</p> <p>The purpose behind the NATO infusion of weaponry into Ukraine was straightforward &ndash; to empower Ukraine to not only lengthen the conflict, but also to undertake offensive military operations designed to evict Russia from what Kiev and its backers consider occupied Ukrainian territory, including the Donbass and Crimea. The counteroffensive in Kharkov in early September underscored the serious consequences of NATO&rsquo;s actions &ndash; even though, given the massive loss of life and material suffered by the attacking Ukrainian forces, made the Kharkov victory Pyrrhic in nature, it was a Ukrainian victory, and one which compelled a Russian retreat.</p> <p>By transforming the Ukrainian army into a NATO army which was manned by Ukrainians, the US-led bloc&nbsp;had, in fact, changed the nature of the game from a straightforward Russia-versus-Ukraine <em>&ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; </em>into a<em> &ldquo;Russia-versus-the collective West</em>&rdquo; struggle where the military resources originally allocated by Moscow to the&nbsp;fight&nbsp;were now insufficient to the task.</p> <p>Advantage, Ukraine/NATO.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Russia, however, was not taking the game-changing actions of NATO standing still. Responding to the new reality on the ground in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin opted not to simply up the ante in this new NATO-driven game of increasing military power but change the game altogether. Not only did he&nbsp;order the partial mobilization of some 300,000 Russian reservists to reinforce the troops currently committed to the SMO, Putin also approved referendums in the four territories where Russian forces are presently fighting &ndash; Kherson and Zaporozhye (formerly occupied Ukrainian regions), and Donetsk and Lugansk (former regions of Ukraine, de-facto independent since 2014). These referendums asked the citizens of these four territories one simple question: do you wish to become part of Russia?</p> <p>After five days of voting, the results from all four territories were clear &ndash; by an overwhelming majority, the participants in the referendums approved the proposition. Shortly thereafter, they&nbsp;were incorporated into the Russian Federation. What was once Ukraine has now become Mother Russia.</p> <p>Russia didn&rsquo;t just change the rules of the game &ndash; it changed the game itself. Instead of Ukrainian forces fighting Russian forces on the territory of Ukraine, any future combat carried out by Ukraine against Russian forces would represent an attack on the Russian homeland itself.</p> <p>Where does this leave NATO? The bloc's leadership has made it clear from day one that it is not seeking direct confrontation with Russia. While its members have poured in tens of billions of dollars of material into Ukraine to help reconstitute its&nbsp;military, and provided critical logistics, intelligence, and communications support to Ukraine, it has repeatedly and insistently stated that it has no desire to fight a war with Russia directly and has made it clear that it would rather have the Ukrainians serve as a de facto NATO proxy in resisting Moscow.</p> <p>NATO has gone &ldquo;<em>all in</em>&rdquo; both economically and politically when it comes to supporting Ukraine, to the extent that some of its members, having stripped their respective military structures of equipment and material, have nothing left to give. Despite this, European political and economic elites continue to articulate their strong support for Ukraine going forward.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>This support, however, was predicated on the fundamental assumption that by providing Ukraine with this massive level of support, NATO would not get directly involved in a conflict with Moscow. But Russia, by transforming the battleground from one being fought on Ukrainian soil to one where it's now defending its own land, has flipped the script.</p> <p>NATO, having overcommitted to Ukraine, now finds itself <em>&ldquo;on the horns of a dilemma</em>&rdquo; &ndash; if it continues to provide massive material and financial support to Ukraine, it will, in effect, become a direct party to the conflict, something no one in the bloc wants. However, if it backs away from supporting Ukraine, the various Western political leaders and institutions which have made support for Kiev a sacred obligation will be seen as going back on their word.</p> <p>How NATO opts to proceed has yet to be manifest, but indications are that it will not be in a manner which continues to double down on supporting Ukraine no matter what. Secretary General Stoltenberg&rsquo;s tepid speech condemning Russia while&nbsp;showing no enthusiasm for Zelensky&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>accelerated application</em>&rdquo; for membership is indicative of the less-than-resolute nature of its support for Kiev.</p> <p>NATO now will find its role diminished by the consequences of the Russian mobilization and referendums.&nbsp;Years from now, when the history of the conflict is finally written, the decision by President Putin to simultaneously mobilize the Russian reserves while absorbing the territory of southern and eastern Ukraine into the Russian Federation will serve as one of the premier modern-history examples of putting an adversary &ldquo;<em>on the horns of a dilemma.&rdquo;</em> The effective neutering of NATO by this action will more than likely be seen as a turning point in the conflict, one which sealed the fate of Ukraine in the face of an inevitable Russian victory.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Seven Americans were exchanged for two relatives of President Maduro</strong></p> <p>Venezuela has released seven Americans, including five oil executives, US President Joe Biden said on Saturday. In return, according to the Venezuelan government, Washington freed two relatives of President Nicolas Maduro who were &ldquo;<em>unjustly detained</em>&rdquo; by the US.</p> <p>Biden said that Washington managed to negotiate the freedom of Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell, Alirio Zambrano, Jose Luis Zambrano, Jose Pereira, Matthew Heath, and Osman Khan, who were &ldquo;<em>wrongfully detained</em>&rdquo; in Venezuela for years.</p> <p>Five of these individuals were executives of Citgo Petroleum Corporation, jailed in 2017 on corruption charges. Another company executive, Gustavo Cardenas, had already been released by the Venezuelan authorities in March.</p> <p>Two other people who were freed are former US Marine Matthew Heath, who was arrested on terrorist charges, and a Florida man, Osman Khan, who was detained for allegedly entering the country illegally from Colombia.</p> <p>In exchange, according to a US official, Biden granted a pardon to Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, both nephews of Maduro&rsquo;s wife. In 2017, they were sentenced to 18 years in prison for conspiring to import cocaine into the US.</p> <p>Maduro&rsquo;s government stated that Caracas, building on the results of talks in March with the US, managed to free two of its citizens who were &ldquo;<em>unjustly</em>&rdquo; held in the US, while the Americans were released for &ldquo;<em>humanitarian reasons</em>.&rdquo;</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>The swap is said to have taken place at an airport in an unspecified third country, with one US official describing the decision to release the Venezuelans as particularly difficult. &ldquo;<em>The president made a tough decision, a painful decision, and offered something that the Venezuelans have actively sought</em>,&rdquo; the official told CNN, adding that the &ldquo;<em>only acceptable outcome</em>&rdquo; for Biden was to free the Americans.</p> <p>The exchange comes as the Biden administration apparently seeks to mend ties with the South American nation. In early June, the US allowed a number of companies to start shipping Venezuelan oil to Europe. According to Reuters, at the time, the US hoped that the oil from the sanctioned country would help the EU become less dependent on Russia.</p> <p>Several months prior, a group of high-ranking US officials traveled to the oil-rich South American nation to meet with Maduro&rsquo;s government.</p> <p>Although the agenda of the talks was unclear, the New York Times reported at the time that the Biden administration sought to &ldquo;<em>separate Russia from its remaining international allies</em>&rdquo; amid the Ukraine conflict.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>State energy major Naftogaz plans to build three power plants fueled by solid waste</strong></p> <p>Ukraine may switch from natural gas to garbage and biomass for heating as early as next year, the CEO of state energy major Naftogaz, Yury Vitrenko, said at a press briefing on Saturday. According to the official, the company could build three combined heating and power plants in Zhitomir that will be powered by municipal solid waste and wood chips.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>Zhytomyr&rsquo;s experience shows that in most cases it is possible by the next heating season to switch from natural gas in heating generation to biomass, garbage</em>,&rdquo; Vitrenko said, as cited by Ukrinform news agency.</p> <p>Vitrenko explained that a cogeneration power and heating plant which will run on these types of fuel is currently under construction in Zhitomir. According to the official, it is more profitable for Naftogaz to launch projects such as this now than to buy gas.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>We are attracting funds from international partners for this purpose. Such projects are technically and economically feasible and help to make the entire energy sector sustainable in the future. We must realize how important it is to switch from natural gas to biomass, alternative sources, heat pumps as soon as possible, because with the market price on gas the payback period of such projects is 2-3 months</em>,&rdquo; Vitrenko stated.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Analysts say it is unlikely that the plans outlined by Vitrenko will be successful. Former Naftogaz spokesman Maksim Beliavsky recently warned that the large-scale conversion of Ukraine&rsquo;s power system to biomass is unrealistic, as it would take $100 million in investments to produce just 1 million cubic meters of biomass energy per year. In 2021, Ukraine burned roughly 19.4 billion cubic meters of gas during the heating season.</p> <p>Last month, Vitrenko warned that Ukraine may face a gas shortage in the upcoming winter, which could lead to power cuts in large parts of the country. He advised Ukrainians to stock up on blankets and warm clothes, noting that this year&rsquo;s heating season will start later and end earlier, while winter temperatures in apartments will be set at 17-18C, four degrees below the standard temperature.</p> <p><strong>For more stories on economy &amp; finance visit <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RT's business section</a></strong></p> <p></p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p><strong>The pipelines were the last thing ensuring EU energy independence, Moscow’s envoy to the UN said</strong></p> <p></p> <p>The sabotage of Russia&rsquo;s Nord Stream gas pipelines benefits the US, not Russia or the EU, Russia&rsquo;s permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia said on Friday.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>The main question is whether what happened to Nord Stream is beneficial to the US? Absolutely. US suppliers of liquefied natural gas should now celebrate a several-fold increase in LNG supplies to the European continent. And from the political point of view &ndash; the last thread ensuring EU independence in the terms of energy has been severed,</em>&rdquo; Nebenzia said at the UN Security Council. He added that while even European production is being hastily transferred to the US amid the energy crisis, Europe's population is now headed toward &ldquo;<em>a very dark, cold and long winter.&rdquo;</em></p> <p><em>&ldquo;Is the destruction of Nord Stream beneficial to European states? Hardly. They would then become dependent on a more expensive and highly unreliable supplier. I am referring to the host country of the UN headquarters [the US]. Leaving aside the Polish, Czech and Baltic politicians, who are completely insane with Russophobia, even with all the anti-Russian hysteria in the EU, experts cannot fail to understand the danger of such a scenario and its consequences for the European economy,</em>&rdquo; the diplomat stressed.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>Furthermore, according to him, &ldquo;<em>if we think in terms of common sense, rather than in the spirit of the morbid fantasy that the Russians are willing to do anything to intimidate Europe,</em>&rdquo; Russia would also hardly benefit from jeopardizing its own pipeline.</p> <p>&ldquo;<em>It makes no sense for us to ruin with our own hands a project in which we have invested an enormous amount of money and from which we could get a substantial economic return. You yourself in the West have said that we make a profit on energy exports and benefit from rising energy prices,</em>&rdquo; Nebenzia pointed out.</p> <p>Danish authorities reported leaks on both the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines on Monday after a local pipeline operator noted a loss of pressure following a series of undersea explosions. The US, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway all deemed the incident to have been sabotage. Russian President Vladimir Putin put the blame for the situation on Western nations, saying that &ldquo;<em>sanctions are not enough for the Anglo-Saxons&rdquo;</em> and that they have now &ldquo;<em>moved to sabotage.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p>At a news conference on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied that the US or NATO countries had anything to do with the damage to the Nord Stream pipelines. US President Joe Biden, meanwhile, accused Russia of spreading disinformation with accusations toward the US and urged the global community not to believe that Washington is to blame for the incident.</p> <p><strong>For more stories on economy &amp; finance visit <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RT's business section</a></strong></p> <p></p> ]]>

During normal times, EU regulations required airlines to operate 80% of their slots. <br /><br />At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the guideline was suspended but then reintroduced at a level of 50%. Last December, the European Commission said the current 50% threshold would be raised to 64% for this year&rsquo;s April-to-November flight season.</p> ]]>
