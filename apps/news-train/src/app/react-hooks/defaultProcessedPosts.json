    "when drm comes for your wheelchair why eff supports colorados right to repair wheelchairs law wheelchairs break three million americans rely on wheelchairs which makes wheelchairs a key driver of the 50 billion durable medical equipment industry many people depend on wheelchairs to help with the basic necessities of life getting around the house going to work shopping and spending time with families this is especially true of powered wheelchairs which integrate sophisticated computers that allow wheelchairs to respond dynamically to their environment anyone whos ever dropped a cellphone or laptop knows that any gadget that travels with you around the world will eventually need repairs this goes double for powered wheelchairs not least because medicare has adopted a narrow interpretation of its statutory obligations and will only pay for indoor chairs despite the fact that the owners of these chairs use them outdoors as well any product that travels with you is likely to break eventually a product that is designed solely for indoor usage but gets used outdoors is even more at risk but for powered wheelchair users this situation is gravely worsened by an interlocking set of policies regarding repair and reimbursement that mean that when their chairs are broken it can take months to get them repaired this has serious consequences wheelchairs are powerful tools that enable mobility and freedom but broken wheelchairs can strand people at homeor even in bed at risk of bedsores and other complications from immobilizationaway from family friends school and work broken wheelchairs can also be dangerous for their users leading to serious injuries stranded stranded is a new report from the public interest research group pirg based on interviews with 141 wheelchair users about their experiences with mechanical and electrical failures in their powered chairs the report documents the dismally frequent incidents of wheelchair failures 93 of respondents needed wheelchair service in the previous year 68 needed two or more repairs and the long service delays that wheelchair users must endure 62 waited four or more weeks for each repair 40 waited seven or more weeks most importantly for addressing this untenable situation the authors tease apart the many factors that lead to these lengthy service delays and endorse legislationcolorados recently passed consumer right to repair powered wheelchairsas a means of bringing immediate dramatic improvements to the lives of wheelchair users the fix is nixed almost everything breaks eventually and good product design isnt merely a matter of making gadgets that dont need frequent serviceits also a matter of making gadgets easy to fix then when they do break down here too medicare rules play a role medicare reimburses wheelchair vendors for parts and laborbut not for their technicians travel to examine pick up and return a wheelchair for wheelchair users with private insurance repairs are delayed while they wait for their insurers to approve their repairs all that means that repair is a moneylosing proposition for large firms so they underinvest in staff training and facilities but as stranded makes clear manufacturers of complex rehabilitation technology crtthe formal classification for powered wheelchairshave adopted repairhostile tactics that make all of this much much worse for wheelchair users why good wheelchairs go bad the pirg report makes it clear that there are complex reasons why its so hard to get your wheelchair fixedand also makes it clear that wheelchair users overwhelmingly support legislation that would let them get service at independent fixit shops or fix their own chairs giving wheelchair users the right to repair wont fix the structural problems with the industry but it will fix their wheelchairs thats an important start so why is it so hard to fix wheelchairs writing for kaiser health news markian hawryluk explains that the powered wheelchair industry is dominated by just two private equityowned companies numotion and national seating and mobility both of whom made deep cuts to their service budgets as part of their private equity owners plans to realize a profit on their investments but the wheelchair duopoly isnt just a result of lax merger scrutiny and private equity buyingsprees medicares competitive bidding process favors large companies that can achieve economies of scale in manufacturing and administrative costs often at the price of quality and customer service to make things worse medicare doesnt cover preventative maintenance and will only replace chairs every five years lets recap powered wheelchair users have to use chairs designed for indoor use even when theyre outside the chairs are made by lowbid contractors who skimp on quality arent entitled to preventative maintenance and must make their chairs last for five years small wonder that these chairs need a lot of service oh great theres drm in wheelchairs now wheelchair users dont want to wait for repair and so they often source their own parts and do their own repairs when confronted with a choice between injury and immobilization or paying out of pocket for parts and tools many wheelchair users feel they have no choice but to pay home repairs that involve powered chairs electronic systems are a different matter not because electronics are more complexbut because manufacturers use digital rights management drm digital locks that are designed to block independent access drm may be more familiar to you from music ebooks video games and movies while drm has been around in various forms since at least 1979 it only came into its own with the passage of the digital millennium copyright act dmca in 1998 section 1201 of the dmca deals with drm it says that trafficking in a tool or even information that helps someone bypass an access control for a copyrighted work is a felony that can be punishable by up to five years in prison and up to 500000 in fines most importantly dmca 1201 doesnt limit itself to banning bypassing drm in order to infringe copyright for example in order to make thousands of copies of a dvd and sell them on the black market that has allowed companies to use copyright law to criminalize businesses that have nothing to do with copyright a company that designs a product that has some drm that prevents repair or maintenance or improvement can use section 1201 to attack anyone who engages in those activities because removing the drm is itself against the law to be clear the dmcas ban on bypassing drm is unconstitutional and gets in the way of many activities beyond repair thats why were suing to overturn it but in the meantime the drm in wheelchairs prevents wheelchair users and independent technicians from diagnosing routine problems with the chairs electronics it also stops wheelchair users from making routine adjustments to their wheelchairs as when a wheelchair user with a balky wheel or failing motor may need to adjust the power wheelchairs speed damping setting which is accomplished using the administrative software or when a wheelchair user who installs a different tire on their chair for navigating inclement weather may want to access administrative software features to adjust the chairs grip parameters access to power wheelchairs electronic systems is often restricted to people with cryptographic security dongles as well as passwords as the pirg report notes without a [hardware] key the diagnostic tool [for chairs with dynamix dx control systems] can display parameter values and diagnostic messages but nothing can be edited or written to a power wheelchairs controller drm also restricts powered wheelchair users access to settings that allow them to finetune their controls arthur torrey describes how badly tuned delays between input devices and steering make controlling a wheelchair like driving with bungee cords he also describes how these restrictions prevent wheelchair users from increasing speed and handling restrictions to keep up with their skill at operating their chairs parts is parts the crt duopoly charge shocking markups on their parts extracting margins that put even the aerospace industry to shame in stranded we read accounts like these had a flat tire new sp innertube was 6 on amazon national crt supplier numotion wanted to replace both wheels at a cost of 300 to medicaid and 68 weeks to get them got the innertubes in 2 days but they would not install them numotion took 4 months and charged 500 for a button that allows bruce to power his wheelchair without it he is stuck in bed got it overnight mailed from ebay for about 20 there are plenty of skilled technicians who can change a button or an innertube including powered wheelchair users themselves robin bouldoc discussed this with the pirg researchers bouldocs husband has primary progressive multiple sclerosis and uses a powered chair with a respirator and a device that allows him to control the chair using head movements she asked why cant the local bicycle shop change the flat tire on our wheelchair arthur torrey is one of the other wheelchair users interviewed for the report he is paraplegic and feels confident that he can perform many routine repairs on his chair theres nothing about manual wheelchairs or power wheelchairs that is that complex or difficult this was affirmed by wheelchair technicians interviewed for the report who said that most repairs to wheelchairs are straightforward and dont require specialized skills or training just a familiarity with mechanical devices but despite this the crt companies refuse to ship parts to wheelchair users blaming medicare and medicaid policies that refuse to reimburse them for parts that are sent to wheelchair users directly right to repair wheelchairs the consumer right to repair powered wheelchairs act hb221031 has passed the colorado legislature and governor jared polis is expected to sign it into law the legislative summary says it all the bill requires a manufacturer to provide parts embedded software firmware tools or documentation such as diagnostic maintenance or repair manuals diagrams or similar information to independent repair providers and owners of the manufacturers powered wheelchairs to allow an independent repair provider or owner to conduct diagnostic maintenance or repair services on the owners powered wheelchair a manufacturers failure to comply with the requirement is a deceptive trade practice in complying with the requirement to provide these resources a manufacturer need not divulge any trade secrets to independent repair providers and owners any new contractual provision or other arrangement that a manufacturer enters into that would remove or limit the manufacturers obligation to provide these resources to independent repair providers and owners is void and unenforceable while this is the first successful right to repair law for wheelchairs it bears a striking similarity to dozens of right to repair laws introduced in state houses that sought to protect your right to fix your phone laptop appliances car or tractor these laws have faced stiff opposition from an axis of powerful antirepair corporate interests from big ag to big tech but the tide is turning new york state just passed an right to repair bill for electronics colorados wheelchairspecific right to repair bill has broken through by forcing companies to bypass their own drm on behalf of wheelchair users and independent repairers the law sidesteps the dmcas prohibition on removing drm making it easier for people who use powered wheelchairs to get them fixed wont solve all the other problems with powered wheelchairs it wont solve the problem of being forced to use indoor chairs outdoors it wont solve the problem of a market concentrated into the hands of two companies that refuse to invest in repair it wont solve medicares refusal to replace chairs when they wear out but safeguarding repair will help people who rely on wheelchairs making it possible for wheelchair users and the technicians they trust to fix their chairs means that while the fight to fix everything else goes on wheelchair users will still have functional chairsand theyll be freed from the cruel bureaucratic nightmare of wheelchair repair monopolies giving them time to fight for the deep structural changes the sector so desperately obviously needs",
    " speechrelated offenses should be excluded from the proposed un cybercrime treaty governments should protect people against cybercrime and they should equally respect and protect peoples human rights however across the world governments routinely abuse cybercrime laws to crack down on human rights by criminalizing speech governments claim they must do so to combat disinformation religious ethnic or sectarian hatred rehabilitation of nazism or the distribution of false information among other harms but in practice they use these laws to suppress criticism and dissent and to more broadly clamp down on the freedoms of expression and association so it is concerning that some un member states are proposing vague provisions to combat hate speech to a committee of government representatives the ad hoc committee convened by the un to negotiate a proposed un cybercrime treaty these proposals could make it a cybercrime to humiliate a person or group or insult a religion using a computer even if such speech would be legal under international human rights law including offenses based on harmful speech in the treaty rather than focusing on core cybercrimes will likely result in overbroad easily abused laws that will sweep up lawful speech and pose an enormous menace to the free expression rights of people around the world the un committee should not make that mistake the un ad hoc committee met in vienna earlier this month for a second round of talks on drafting the new treaty some member states put forward during and ahead of the session vague proposals aimed at online hate speech including egypt jordan russia belarus burundi china nicaragua tajikistan kuwait pakistan algeria and sudan others made proposals aimed at racist and xenophobic materials including algeria pakistan sudan burkina faso burundi india egypt tanzania jordan russia belarus burundi china nicaragua and tajikistan for example jordan proposes using the treaty to criminalize hate speech or actions related to the insulting of religions or states using information networks or websites while egypt calls for prohibiting the spreading of strife sedition hatred or racism russia jointly with belarus burundi china nicaragua and tajikistan also proposed to outlaw a wide range of vaguely defined speech intending to criminalize protected speech the distribution of materials that call for illegal acts motivated by political ideological social racial ethnic or religious hatred or enmity advocacy and justification of such actions or to provide access to such materials by means of ict information and communications technology as well as humiliation by means of ict information and communications technology of a person or group of people on account of their race ethnicity language origin or religious affiliation speech offences dont belong in the proposed cybercrime treaty as we have previously said only crimes that target icts should be included in the proposed treaty such as those offenses in which icts are the direct objects and instruments of the crimes and could not exist without the ict systems these include illegal access to computing systems illegal interception of communications data theft and misuse of devices so crimes where icts are simply a tool that is sometimes used to commit an offense like the proposals before the un ad hoc committee should be excluded from the proposed treaty these crimes are merely incidentally involving or benefiting from ict systems without targeting or harming icts the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights ohchr highlighted in january that any future cybercrime treaty should not include offenses based on the content of online expression > cybercrime laws have been used to impose overly broad restrictions on free expression by criminalizing various online content such as extremism or hate speech further harmful speech should not be included among cybercrimes because of the inherent difficulties in defining prohibited speech hate speech the subject of several proposals is an apt example of the dangers raised by including speechrelated harms in a cybercrime treaty because we lack a universally agreed upon definition of hate speech in international human rights law using the term hate speech is unhelpful in identifying permissible restrictions to speech hate speech can mean different things to different people and capture a broad range of expressions including awful but lawful speech vague or overbroad laws criminalizing speech can lead to censorship both statesanctioned and selfcensorship of legitimate speech because internet users are left uncertain about what speech is disallowed hate speech is many times conflated with hate crimes a confusion that can be problematic when drafting an international treaty not all hate speech is a crime restrictions on speech can come in the form of criminal civil administrative policy or selfregulatory measures although article 20 2 of the un international covenant of civil and political rights iccpr made clear that any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence must be prohibited by law prohibition does not necessarily equal criminalization indeed criminal sanctions are measures of last resort invoked only in the most extreme situations as article19org explained only the most severe types of hate speech that may appropriately attract criminal sanction include incitement to genocide and particularly severe forms of advocacy of discriminatory hatred that constitute an incitement to violence hostility or discrimination international law already provides sufficient guidance on speech that can be restricted as inciting hatred and thus should not be included in the treaty additional and conflicting provisions regarding online hate speech in the cybercrime treaty are unnecessary and unwise broad speech protection and very narrow limitations on speech at the heart of any limitations on the right to free expression must sit the universal declaration of human rights udhr and the iccpr to which the un member states that are negotiating the new un cybercrime treaty are parties article 19 of the iccpr provides broad protection of freedom of expression it protects the right to seek receive and impart all kinds and forms of expression through any media of ones choice states may limit these rights in only very narrow circumstances article 193 of the iccpr lays down conditions any restriction on freedom of expression must meet requiring that any limitation comply with the following test it must be provided for by law legality designed to achieve a legitimate aim be proportionate to that legitimate aim and necessary for a democratic society the un human rights committees general comment 34 has established that these standards apply to online speech deeply offensive expression blasphemy defamation of religion incitement to terrorism and violent extremism are not categorically subject to permissible limitations any limitations on those categories of speech must like most other categories of speech satisfy the article 193 test both the un special rapporteur on freedom of expression and the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination cerd have underlined that speech prohibitions must satisfy the article 193 test moreover they must primarily be civil sanctions criminal sanctions are measures of last resort invoked only in the most extreme situations such as instances of imminent violence the un human rights committees general comment 34 and cerd general recommendation 35 also confirm that any limitations on speech must comply with the article 19 test incitement to discrimination hostility or violence the standard although incitement is a category of speech that may presently be restricted existing international law provides sufficient guidance on how states should respond to it its inclusion in the cybercrime treaty is not needed and will only sow confusion as mentioned before iccpr article 20 2 requires member states to prohibit the advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence based on the following categories nationality race color ethnicity language religion national or social origin political or other opinion gender sexual orientation property birth disability or other status in its 2012 report the un special rapporteur developed a standard to assess article 20 prohibitions that focuses on intent incitement and particular harm first the speaker must intend to publicly advocate and promote national racial or religious hatred towards the specific group next the speech must create an imminent risk of discrimination hostility or violence against the group members finally incitement must aim at producing discrimination hostility or violence against the group to meet these standards at the national level the member states have the following obligations adopt precise and unambiguous restrictions to combat advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that amounts to incitement to discrimination hostility or violence legal attempts to punish hate speech are often too vague or too broad it is also unclear whether states prohibitions against advocacy of hatred that constitutes incitement fall under iccpr article 20 or actually target legitimate speech only enact speech restrictions that have legitimate aims as prescribed under iccpr article 19 and 20 or cerd article 4 legitimate aim principles include respecting the rights and reputation of others and protecting national security public order or public health or morals even here the restrictions must be narrowly tailored there must be a pressing or substantial need and restrictions must not be overbroadbanning speech because its critical isnt a legitimate aim further the protection of morals which reflect social or religious traditions shouldnt be based on the principles of a single tradition under iccpr general comment 34 blasphemy laws speech restrictions that discriminate in favor or against a certain religion and prohibitions against criticism of religious leaders are not legitimate aims opt for measures that do not unnecessarily and disproportionately interfere with freedom of expression when the article 193 test is met member states must demonstrate that the speech in question poses an imminent threat of harm and applies the least intrusive means of restricting speech to achieve a legitimate objective in addition the speakers intent to cause harm must be examined this test has a very high threshold and many laws have failed to comply with such standards myanmars hate speech law contained an unlawfully vague definition of hate speech crime spains speechrelated offenses did not sufficiently distinguish between the severity of the expression and the impact that speech in having to determine proportionate sanctions that comply with articles 2020 and 193 frances avia law also attempted to tackle hateful content online but was declared unconstitutional spread of disinformation there is even less agreement on a universal definition of disinformation in international human rights law disinformation laws are too often vague and overbroad capturing protected expression as human rights watch explained false information can be hotly contested > the spread of disinformation that undermines human rights and online genderbased violence requires a government response however government responses to these human rights challenges that focus on the criminalization of content can also lead to disproportionate rights restrictions particularly the right to freedom of expression and privacy all kinds of information and ideas are protected under iccpr article 19 even those that may shock offend or disturb regardless of whether the content is true or false people have the right to hold and express unsubstantiated views or share parodies or satirical expressions as the un special rapporteur on the freedom of expression noted prohibition of false information is not a legitimate aim under the international human rights law the free flow of information is an integral part of freedom of expression which is especially important in political speech on matters of public interest while disinformation disseminated intentionally to cause social harm is problematic the un special rapporteur emphasized that so too are vague criminal laws that chill online speech and shrink civic space the 2017 joint declaration on freedom of expression and fake news disinformation and propaganda provides key principles under international human rights law to assist states companies journalists and other stakeholders in addressing disinformation for example member states are encouraged to create an enabling environment for free expression ensure that they disseminate reliable and trustworthy information and adopt measures to promote media and digital literacy in its resolution 4412 the un human rights council stated that responses to disinformation should always comply with legality legitimacy necessity and proportionality principles as with hate speech vague prohibitions on disinformation will rarely meet the legality standard for example the joint statement of the un special rapporteur the osce representative on freedom of media and the iachr special rapporteur for freedom of expression sounded the alarm about the rise of overbroad fake news bills in the context of the covid19 pandemic human rights watch documented the application of these laws and eff expressed its concerns on these bills too on the specific topic of electoral disinformation the un special rapporteur has said that electoral laws prohibiting the propagation of falsehoods in the electoral process may meet the article 193 test additionally such restrictions should be narrowly construed timelimited and tailored to avoid limiting political debate despite these cautions numerous proposals were presented to the un ad hoc committee that would create new cybercrimes of misinformation tanzania proposed to outlaw the publication of false information jordan suggests including the dissemination of rumors or false news through information systems networks or websites russia jointly with belarus burundi china nicaragua and tajikistan called for prohibiting the intentional illegal creation and use of digital information capable of being mistaken for information already known and trusted by a user causing substantial harm once again these vague provisions will hardly satisfy human rights standards their practical interpretation and application will have an adverse effect on fundamental rights and result in more harm than good the way forwardexclude offenses based on the content of online expression eff joins its partners including article 19 accessnow priva and human rights watch in urging the un member states to exclude contentrelated offenses from the proposed un cybercrime treaty in a letter to the un ad hoc committee eff and more than 130 civil society groups warned that cybercrime laws have already been weaponized to target journalists whistleblowers political dissidents security researchers lgbtq communities and human rights defenders member states dont have any room for error when drafting a global treaty they should find consensus to exclude speechrelated offenses from the un cybercrime treaty",
    "eff to interamerican court of human rights colombias surveillance of human rightsdefending lawyers group violated international law eff article 19 fundación karisma and privacy international represented by berkeley laws international human rights law clinic urged the interamerican court of human rights to rule that colombias existing legal framework regulating intelligence activities and the unlawful and arbitrary surveillance of members of the jose alvear restrepo lawyers collective cajar and their families violated a constellation of human rights including the rights to privacy freedom of expression and association and forced cajar members to limit their activities change homes and go into exile to avoid violence threats and harassment members of cajar a colombian human rights organization defending victims of political persecution indigenous people and activists for over 40 years have had their communications intercepted by colombian intelligence agencies and faced ongoing threats and intimidation since the 1990s eff and its partners said in an amicus brief submitted to the court in cajars lawsuit against the colombian state since at least 1999 colombian authorities have subjected cajar members to constant pervasive secret surveillance on every facet of their professional and personal lives including their locations activities finances travel contacts clients and protection measures the brief demonstrates that colombias intelligence law and unlawful communication surveillance practices violate the right to privacy and other human rights under the american convention on human rights the brief also provides evidence of the range of targeted and mass surveillance tools employed by the state in short > while international law permits targeted surveillance in limited circumstances and with strict safeguards mass surveillance is an inherently disproportionate interference with the international human rights to privacy but in the last few years law enforcement and intelligence services in colombia have purchased tools to expand their pervasive spying network and capture large amounts of communication data as the brief explains colombia employs both targeted and mass surveillance tools colombian authorities collect monitor and intercept in realtime individual audio and data communications from mobile and landline phones intelligence authorities intercept communications data without prior authorization or judicial oversight with direct access to communication networks despite the fact that colombian law does not authorize any agency to engage in communications interception outside the confines of criminal investigations and without judicial oversight colombian intelligence services also have conducted intrusive operations exploiting software data computer systems or networks to gain access to user information and devices this case presents an unprecedented opportunity for the court to examine whether colombias intelligence surveillance practices and legal regime comport with the american convention the brief filed on may 24 said if it finds violations the court can establish measures to be taken by colombia to strengthen safeguards against government surveillance these include requiring prior judicial authorization effective independent oversight and transparency measures like notifying people targeted by surveillance to ensure effective remedies in case of abuse testimony during the hearing presenting the case to the court in may has also provided clear indications of abusive government surveillance practices an expert witness defending colombias intelligence laws compliance with human rights standards explained that the monitoring of electromagnetic spectruma surveillance measure authorized by the lawcould entail monitoring conversations within an entire city zone public hearing at 22800 in spanish he mentioned the random nature of the monitoring which is not targeted to specific persons as a positive feature and justification for not requiring a prior judicial authorization however such random dragnet surveillance cant be deemed compatible to the american conventions necessity and proportionality standards the expert witness also said the use of malicious software for intelligence activities is regulated in colombia in the sense it is channeled within the monitoring tasks as per the intelligence law public hearing at 20013 in spanish yet the law does not contain any particular authorization for the use of malware technology this means that aside from proportionality concerns the use of malware raises colombias intelligence law does not clearly and precisely authorize the state to employ this type of technologywhich the principle of legality requires under international human rights law colombia has argued that its intelligence law approved in 2013 following media reports unveiling wrongful surveillance by intelligence agencies targeting human rights defenders and journalists establishes specific circumstances under which intelligence activities can be authorized the government claimed the law ensures that any intelligence action conforms to the principles of legality proportionality and necessity and provides human rights safeguards at various levels yet the brief explains that colombias intelligence legal framework has enabled abusive surveillance practices in violation of the american convention and has not prevented authorities from unlawfully surveilling harassing and attacking cajar members even after colombia enacted the new law authorities continued to carry out unlawful communications surveillance against cajar members using an expansive and invasive spying system to target and disrupt the work of human rights defenders journalists and others the brief builds on the most protective understanding of international human rights law and standards held by international courts and human rights bodies it urges the interamerican court to establish rigorous human rights protections that limit state surveillance and prevent future violations with this case the court has a crucial opportunity to ensure that the american conventions safeguards are applied to and serve as a check on unparalleled state surveillance powers employed in the digital age",

    "san francisco police nailed for violating public records laws regarding face recognition and fusion center documents by unanimous vote san franciscos public records appeals body ruled last night that the san francisco police department sfpd violated state and local laws when it failed to respond adequately to effs requests for documents about face recognition and the departments relationship with the northern california regional intelligence center ncric the bay areas fusion center the sunshine ordinance task force further ordered sfpd to conduct a fresh search for records and respond pointbypoint to effs original records request within 5 days or potentially face sanctions in the summer of 2019 san francisco became the first major us city to ban government use of face recognition a technology that extracts information about a persons face and compares that data to a database of images in order to establish identity sfpds compliance with the ban came into question in september 2020 when the san francisco chronicle reported that sfpd had circulated a bulletin containing a surveillance camera image of a suspect and in response ncric staff used face recognition on the image and forwarded the results to sfpd eff and other organizations were concerned that this practice could constitute an endrun around the ban eff followed up by submitting a public records request to sfpd under the san francisco sunshine ordinance asking for 11 different categories of documents ranging from original bulletins and correspondence regarding the original case general discussions over face recognition between sfpd and external parties and all documents that establish the relationship between ncric and sfpd despite seeking a time extension sfpd provided only one document an email statement to reporters regarding the incident in the chronicle article sfpd claimed some of the records were wholesale exempt because they were investigative for the remaining items sfpd claimed it could not locate any records such as standard agreements that govern sfpds formal partnership with the fusion center eff filed a formal complaint with the task force and only then did sfpd reevaluate its response it then provided 20 pages of previously unreleased documents including the bulletin and emails it received from other agencies that reviewed the image the other documents remained elusive the gears of oversight often move slow and so it took a year and a half for effs complaint to reach a full hearing before the task force during the hearing eff testified that sfpd only provided records after the agency faced a formal complaint however we also highlighted the missing documents such as the fusion center agreements as we told the task force its difficult to understand how sfpd could not find any information considering the city has two members of sfpds special investigations unit assigned to ncric and chief [william] scott is chair of the ncric executive board if true then sfpd would be irresponsibly engaged in an intelligence and data sharing partnership without any record of the rules limitations and obligations of the agencies involved we also raised skepticism about sfpds claim that it could not find a single email discussing face recognition technology in the year and a half since the ban took effect sfpd stood by its determination and provided no further insight into its decisions unpersuaded the task force found that sfpd had violated sections 6253b and c of the california public records act for failing to provide records in a timely manner as well as 6727d and 6726 of the sunshine ordinance for failing to keep withholding of information to a minimum and failing to justify such withholding in addition pursuant to section 6721e of the ordinance the task force ordered sfpd to comply with the remainder of our request within 5 days under the law if the agency fails to comply the task force must report the violation to the district attorney or attorney general initially the task force voted to refer the matter to the san francisco ethics commission for investigation of willful failure to comply with the law a form of official misconduct however they rescinded that vote because it was unclear which official at sfpd should be named in the referral task force members indicated that this option would remain available should sfpd fail to comply with its order no agency and especially not the police department should require a member of the public to file a complaint before they provide information to the public and no agency should get away with claiming it cant find records that plainly should exist as we said during the hearing a transparent and accountable government can only function if these errors are confirmed and documented by an independent body we applaud the task force for its ruling and look forward to seeing what if any records sfpd produces next week and if sfpd doesnt produce these records the task force should escalate the case for further investigation or prosecution",

self defense surveillance self defense attending a protest intellectual property and remixes intellectual property the term legal guide for bloggers intellectual property fair use one weird trick to improve copyright fix eulas transcript anil dash so josh wardle made a word game for his partner because she wanted to be able to play this word game every day and at an architectural level it is radical because it is simple and it is a throwback to an internet that many people have forgotten about what happened after that was the glitch community took the idea and ran with it they made remixes and so people have made i mean the last count was well over a thousand remixes of wordle on glitch and thats sort of branched off into all these different worlds now and whats been most amazing for me to see is the majority of remixes weve seen on glitch have been from kpop fans so we have a huge community of mostly teenage girls who love kpop korean pop music which is global pop music now and so thats pretty remarkable that we have on an average afternoon a handful of new apps made by young women will pop up about the groups that they like and then people play it they share their scores the key takeaway here is pop culture tied directly to broad individual creation of independent websites that all run on their own addresses created by individual people with no surveillance no tracking no connection to any of the big silos complete open source the ability to take it and actually run it somewhere elsethe web that we are told we are fighting for exists every day and millions of people are participating in it cindy thats anil dash hes the ceo of glitch and hes also on the effs board of directors anil thinks a lot about many things but today were going to focus on how we can build a grassroots movement to support better technology danny anil is going to tell us what we need to do to make tech be more relevant and to build involvement beyond the converted cindy im cindy cohn effs executive director danny and im danny obrien special advisor to eff welcome to how to fix the internet a podcast of the electronic frontier foundation cindy hi anil were just delighted that you agreed to join us anil hello im so glad to be here cindy tell me the problem as you see it why is tech not reaching out in the way that it ought to galvanize movements to get us to a better internet anil thats a big question but i think about first learning from other movements so were in an amazing moment for example of people fighting for a higher minimum wage in the us danny right anil they call it the fight for 15 and its very clear you know if you got paid 15 bucks an hour or not and you know what youre asking for and i think about movements like that are so galvanizing because of their clarity youll know when you win and if somebody says this big tech company did something wrong about privacy okay yeah i believe that thats easy to believe and they said what do we want and if we dont know what it would take to win then do we have a movement at all i think thats the challenge we have because as soon as we have that clarity we wont have to do anything to galvanize many more people joining in and wanting to be part of it danny it is a hard task and it is something that someone has to explicitly do i guess the question maybe we should all be talking about is how do you even begin to think about that what is better tech what is a better internet anil i think one of the most important things is about knowing that this is not the beginning of a moment i dont want to obsess too much about the fight for 15 but i think its a great example theres a couple centuries of prior art there to learn from about what constitutes a fair wage for people and so if you look at this moment one of the reasons we have as many challenges as we do in tech is theres almost this insistence that nothing came before were the beginning of history all the time cindy yes anil and i have enough gray in my beard and everybody has that enough mileage on their sneakers to know this isnt the first time weve had these issues before in many cases its not the first time the people who are making these mistakes have made these mistakes this is not the first time anybodys thought about these problems and what could we learn about what did and didnt work in the past cindy i want to flip this around just a little bit so tell us your vision what if we get this all right and then maybe we can back into our slogan a little bit anil thats the hard part isnt it its like i know what i dont like its almost the inverse of ill know it when ill see it theres very obviously this trickle down architecture first well help the people that have the fastest phones the fastest connections the most wealth the most security the most stability and then everybody else will benefit later and that part always gets overlooked so i think theres an orientation to service an orientation to alignment to who youre serving that is a north star so thats one part it sounds nebulous but its far more falsifiable its far more testable than you might imagine i think very often you can say can this technology be used by somebody whos unhoused can this technology be used by somebody whos unbanked can this technology be used by somebody with an intermittent connection can this technology be used by somebody who if they revealed some aspect of their identity to their employer to their government would be in danger a very short list we can just rattle off five of them and we can probably come up with five more and cover a couple billion people that we care about that list lives in my head because i do product work every day im lucky i get to work on a product with a team that cares about that but i think thats got to be the north star at least youre making informed decisions there but i dont think thats the process for much of especially silicon valley but in general danny one of the parts we struggle with as a movement as much as anything is what do you call that relationship anil yeah danny so theres customer theres user or consumer another one that i feel really uncomfortable with cindy thats grim anil thats a really grim one danny yeah because its so hard to explain because you go youre not just consuming youre not just this spigot that receives these things anil yeah theres a dehumanizing rhetoric i think the language reveals the thought this happened when i used to say i was a writer i write on the internet and now the default stance is that people generate content cindy right anil when the phrase user generated content came out it was such an absurd framing that i think those of us who were users who were generating content were like this sounds like a parody its nothing you would ever say to a person and now i talk to young people who introduce themselves to me as content creators cindy yes danny right anil and the idea that and im the old guy talking about the 20th century idea of dont sell out and youre not going to license your song for a commercial like this stuff thats very anachronistic im aware that time has passed for that moment for a lot of people but the idea that you would willingly describe something that comes from your heart and soul as content its extremist framing its actually very radical framing and i think that sense that we forget how radical the thought processes have gotten for lots of folks like the overton window has shifted so radically that the language is only evidence of it having happened and so i keep coming back to that of we concede so much just by how we even talk about things cindy so who are we what should we be anil i struggle with this a lot because i help run glitch and its a company where people make apps but we talk a lot about having a community and im struck because i think everybody does i think every platform ive ever read in the last 20 years is we have a community a community of users we have all these things and it could be the most hostile place in the world it can be spying on their users it can be deleting their data it can be undermining their jobs and its like we got a community cindy yeah when zuckerberg calls facebook a community it just [inaudible 001336] anil these words dont mean anything and i struggle because i do mean it and i take it very seriously in the same way that i attend a community board meetings in my neighborhood really seriously because its a community and so the city council members roll their eyes when they see me show up because they know im going to be there and thats what community is enough to be exasperating to the people in charge and thats what i tell the team all the time were in charge we should be exasperated thats the definition of being a community thats not happening at 99 of the organizations that talk about having communities so we dont have a word for whats right cindy it is strange to have people defining themselves from the perspective of the platform when theyre the artist anil thats right cindy youre a content creator only from the perspective of the people who built the platform that youre creating the content for thats whose perspective it is for many people theyre an artist anil i think of a pop culture example like zach snyder he makes a superhero film and then they dont put it out the right way and then he goes to the studios and hes like youre going to put out my version and they spend whatever they spend a hundred billion dollars to do it and hes not saying im a content creator for hbo hes not saying that thats not what hes doing steven spielberg is not a content creator for a movie studio and i think theres that sense of owning your work and knowing what you are in the world that is denied by people who are sort of born into that framing you take somebody like beyonce she is not a content creator shes like i know what im worth ill be on netflix ill be on spotify ill be wherever you need to be but youre going to pay me youre going to give me control and im an artist inarguably and i dont think youre going to have most generation z coming up with that sense of selfagency control and ownership even though thats what the internet promised them and when we were all excited about the web in the early days of the web it was like everybodys going to own their own work and theyre going to have this control danny there are some things where people go oh well start a union that will develop a relationship between us and the company that we work for and so we see a renewal in that as people try and work out a way of managing that power relationship anil right danny its hard to imagine a union of users but maybe we could how can people regain or have that control over the technology that seems to dominate their lives anil one i wouldnt concede that at all i think absolutely users can organize and say we want to own and control our data but we already have examples of this i think of the delete uber hashtag trending on twitter and that was material enough that it got disclosed in the next quarterly reports of the company and in their ipo filing and that was a couple of folks that started it and it caught momentum and it had real impact on a multibillion dollar company i think theres been media based lobbying about the algorithms of facebook and companies like that i think the biggest thing is obviously regulation is the one people talk about but weve let go at least in most of the western world of public shame as a mechanism were in a post shame world but there are still people in silicon valley that dont want to be ashamed and people that work in tech that dont want to be ashamed i think the workers are a really great place to go i think telling people like do you want to be complicit in what this company is doing and you have other options because tech workers are the most demand workers in the world i think those are points of leverage that have not been explored at all in terms of driving change cindy we recently got apple to back down on some of its breaking of end to end encryption we did some high profile things like flying a banner over apple when they were having a big meeting and things like that anil you got to have fun cindy you should have fun i dont know if you cant dance i dont want to be part of your revolution the people inside apple the workers were the ones who were really pressuring to make a change in course and i feel like weve tried many times to talk to tech workers about things and i feel like we just need to keep working until we get it right anil yeah cindy and i feel like we havent quite figured that out and if youve got ideas of course im all ears anil i dont know the answer but i know the traits of the answer i think one of the things is to say a movement has to have a name and an identity enough that people know that theyre part of it if you are a worker at a company that is building a product that is not going to respect peoples privacy but youre a good actor and youd like to fix that how do you throw up the bat signal what hashtag do you use if you wanted to say i want to galvanize everybody in the world who cares about this there is a signal you can throw up that is going to galvanize the people who care about it and are aligned with you and that doesnt mean everybodys going to be agreeing it just means that youre going to be able to get the eyes of the people who do agree with you and yet what i find across the board if i say what would be acceptable to you say to somebody whats a technology that would be okay for you and for me my list its like i want environmental concerns addressed i want ethical concerns addressed i want user privacy concerns addressed i have a list right but thats not where the conversation is danny i think one of the things is that its very easy to fall into just two responses one is to be extremely excited about the technology and the other is to say i dont want this and i want it to go away and neither of those things are going to play out that way it is not going to usher in a new utopia but is not going to go away either and so what you have to do is to work out a way of steering it sort of riding this strange new force in the direction that you want it to go anil we cant evaluate whether it meets our ethical moral social cultural standards unless we know what our standards are danny right anil and its so interesting because techies love technical conformance we love to be like this is in compliance with the spec and then we sort of say okay but whats our spec for the world we dont have one cindy right cindy so what i hear you saying which i think is really right which is we need to ask ourselves how is our technology that were building going to impact the most marginal people in society i think that if that question has been asked and answered in a good way thats part of our better world what else what else in our better world do you see anil its such a tricky question i think theres a lot of aspects around agency and ownership one of the things we can sort of picture very easily is can i take my ball and go home cindy yes anil i think thats just sort of one of those fundamentals and its a very old fashioned idea it seems to be coming back into vogue with a lot of the web3 enthusiasm its funny because the early days of web 20 the hype was data is the new intel inside and there was this sort of trust based idea youd be able to export your data or something its like everybody will be nice to you and it turns out actually that doesnt work at all and everybody just went to fully locked into every platform that they use so that to me feels like a thing thats wide open to be reinvented cindy and facebook even let you download stuff but its a bunch of gibberish right anil right thats exactly the example i was going to say is i get this giant mine is like a gigabyte plus of like my archive and im like what am i going to do with this take it to some other app like this doesnt have any use in the world and so it became this sort of fig leaf just like open source was often used as like were not evil because were open source i think a lot of that happened with you got your data now arent you happy and it was the letter but not the spirit of openness danny how to fix the internet is supported by the alfred p sloan foundations program in public understanding of science enriching peoples lives through a keener appreciation of our increasingly technological world and portraying the complex humanity of scientists engineers and mathematicians one of the backdrops of everything were talking about is that we have these big massive postindustrial combines like facebook and google and we have to lobby them or regulate them or shame them or motivate the people within them who have power to change them but that really wasnt the dream originally with the internet the internet was going to be this thing that would empower people to actually be able to take control of their own lives take control of their own technology do you think thats still a possibility is there still a role that technology can play rather than political action to empower people anil the ideal is still possible the challenge is the society around the ideal the architecture of the internet is such that we were all supposed to have our own domains and run our own email and our own website on them and the like and that aint how it played out it can never be solely technological but you can absolutely imagine technology as part of that solution we can imagine certainly the combination of technology and regulation mandating some degree of interoperability on such things but i think there actually is one that is really culpable in this not having more users which is the people who care deeply about these issues and have the technical skill in order to build alternatives generally are so invested in being gatekeepers of their own technical mastery that they dont make them usable for normal people and so theres this interesting thing where its like i look down on having all my data in one of these giant silos from the big companies but also i look down on users who dont know how to run their own server on the internet danny this comes back to this thing of youll still a long way from the people who are most vulnerable and most in need of this technology anil thats right there are camps that believe in only the tech titans having control and then a camp that believes in nominally individual users having control but in real practice neither of them is very good about caring for the most vulnerable anyway danny you work on glitch and glitch is for those of you who dont know it is a kind of a system for helping people build just the tools and websites and programs that people can use on the web themselves its design to be an easy to use way of building these apps do you think about embodying these values when you are designing stuff like glitch or do you see these as separate worlds anil oh yeah every day this is why i do it cindy could we have an example anil ill give you an example from outside because im very proud of what we do but i want to be clear its part of a larger movement so i think the example that comes to mind for me in 2022 is wordle danny oh yeah anil so word wordle is amongst many other things in act of love so josh wardle made a word game for his partner because she wanted to be able to play this word game every day and at an architectural level it is radical because it is simple and it is a throwback to an internet that many people have forgotten about it is a single page on the web that you play this game on it doesnt have tons of tracking you cant log into it it doesnt even attempt to finagle your data out of you and its fun and it cant try to steal your attention because youre limited to only playing it once per day and if youre spending more than five minutes playing the game youre really bad at it and probably not having fun so its sort of got a ceiling cindy maybe 10 but okay anil okay 10 well put 10 but the point is if youre spending hours a day as much as people are spending on tiktok then thats not the place for you this is not the game for you and so i think the thing is that it is structurally aligned with a healthy web and it is the biggest phenomenon in the consumer internet this year and its made by a guy by a person and so i keep calling it the wordle wide web like that version of the internet we were told is dead and cant succeed it has to be in an app store it has to be distributed through facebook it has to surveil you and has to be getting vc money and all this list of things and it makes obvious that is a lie no surprise to me what happened after that was the glitch community took the idea and ran with it they made remixes and so people have made i mean the last count was well over a thousand remixes of wordle on glitch and thats sort of branched off into all these different worlds now so there are really tellingly identity based ones theres one of the earliest remix this was called queerdle and its like this is queer culture and then because of how remix culture works online and because the web is open it went whole different direction like the last couple weeks has been so theres heardle heardle and those are song guessing and this is sort of like those were about guessing words but this is name that tune this is not a new idea and whats been most amazing for me to see in these last two weeks is the majority of remixes weve seen on glitch have been from kpop fans so we have a huge community of mostly teenage girls who love kpop korean pop music which is global pop music now and so they pick their favorite band and they take their songs and they make a heardle remix just for the group that they like or just for the genre that they like and so thats pretty remarkable that we have on an average afternoon a handful of new apps made by young women will pop up about the groups that they like and then people play it they share their scores the key takeaway here is pop culture tied directly to broad individual creation of independent websites that all run on their own addresses created by individual people with no surveillance no tracking no connection to any of the big silos complete open source the ability to take it and actually run it somewhere else when you get it downloaded its not something thats tied into the system the web that we are told we are fighting for exists every day and millions of people are participating in it but now its just becoming visible again cindy i love that story danny does it change that calculus that wordle itself was brought up by the new york times and actually does have tracking on it and you do log in anil yeah kind of but i was sort of torn at the end of the day if somebody makes a great app for their loved one and then they get a million dollars and sell it tonew york times good for them i think a younger me wouldve been much more radicalized by that but im like you know thats not the worst outcome but actually part of it is that my impression from josh who made it he used to work at reddit and everything else hes probably going to get paid more for that than he did from working at reddit or something like that so the idea that theres more of a return as opposed to whether its the venture backed model or the publicly traded companies model like those dont always reward their workers commensurate to the value that they create danny right anil and so i think that sort of has to be the benchmark as opposed to keep it pure and dont make any money on this thing because im like we tried having that as our aesthetic maybe as late as the 90s the beatles had their song license to the nike commercial and a bunch of boomers got mad and that idea of caring about that level of selling out at a time when every rapper has their own perfume and clothing line and whatever is just anachronistic so i think that sense of the purity of it being noncommercial its actually not a battle we could win but the idea of agency control creativity response connection to culture and genuine democratization to a demographic that has been overlooked and disrespected by the tech platforms that is all doable cindy the key there is the openness the fact that somebody can take this thing and turn it into something that works for themselves just their three friends or their whole communityi dont care if the new york times takes wordle and turns it into something i dont want i got a hundred other choices danny the thing that is also really important here is the thing that isnt happening which is that the new york times is not suing all of these wordles out of existence which is important because the reason why theyre not doing that is they know that would be an absolute nightmare they have the legal capability to do that but the norm the norm is that you do not do that on the internet because the internet will hit back cindy im wondering if you have thoughts about how do we bring people in those communities into this movement anil yeah cindy and how do we get the kpop kids to recognize that we need them to stand up how do we mobilize those communities better because i think thats something we struggle with in tech a lot anil there are so many natural affinities that i think we can do better at connecting to one of the ones that jumps out to me is in seeing the mobilization against police violence here in new york city after the death of george floyd the first thing that organizers were doing at marches was essentially teaching digital security to people almost all young people coming out to these protests and these marches and they were walking them through what to do with their phones and what to install and how to run their browser it was extraordinary because they saw the first step of participating in protests or civil disobedience is digital fluency and so it was incredible and now i think its wonderful eff has responded with resources for any kind of protestor and i think thats incredibly powerful but even going and beyond that i do think everybody cares about intellectual property now everybody in the world cares about it like it is such a broad thing and it used to be a couple lawyers cared or a couple like obsessives cared and now it is every day and absolutely fan culture and remixed culture which are just culture theyre all society now are entirely predicated on a deep level of fluency in sometimes arcane aspects of intellectual property law and so that to me is like thats fertile ground im a big fan and scholar of princes work and seeing his very zealous lawyers go in and take an overly aggressive stance if for understandable reasons about ip was a huge learning experience for that fan community they were not intrinsically motivated to learn about these things but at the same time they were also learning about trademark prince had changed his name to a symbol and he had a trademark on the symbol and they learned the difference between copyright and trademark and he filed for a patent they learned a patent and i was like fan communities teach each other a lot im struck pop music fans in general now their level of knowledge about corporate structures and licensing agreements and publishing agreements is off the charts all those things were things that were somewhat esoteric then that are fundamental to like a 13 year olds fandom now anybody who has an artist they love or a fandom that theyre part of a community like that real community not the tech version of community but a real community thats the entry point culture and art that moves us is the entry point to which we start to learn about these things because then its not abstract and then its not esoteric and off putting it is about something thats meaningful to us thats how we bring people in is to say these things you care about are directly shaped directly affected by policy by the practice of these companies by the way that things are fairly or unfairly enforced i think we can make things relevant to a lot broader audience cindy anil thank you so much for taking this time to talk with us what a fascinating conversation going in a bunch of different directions that were not the ones we anticipated but always fun danny from wordle to prince i dont think those were the things that i had scribbled on the back of an envelope when we came in cindy with kpop in between danny yeah thanks so much cindy big thanks to anil for joining us today the first thing we talked about is something that weve heard consistently across this podcast is that we need the people who are affected by technologies and especially those who are the most marginalized the technologies need to serve them and this is just so consistent across all the people that we talk to danny and also you cant have an approach to technology unless you know what you are ultimately aiming for you need to be able to steer the technology and that means having very clear messages about what you want when you put up a bat signal for grassroots movements they need clarity they need to know what you stand for cindy i loved his example of how weve taken the idea of being an artist and turned it into a content creator and how its become just so embedded that the people who are making things and doing things are a piece of somebody elses story rather than the main story danny in terms of strategy and tactics i do think that this emerging possibility that tech workers can influence positive change at tech companies i think again thats a recurring theme but i think he put a real point on it im not sure about the term shame actually i kind of disagreed with the anil there i think that what hes describing is correct but i dont think the method is shame i think its actually just illustrating getting people to see the consequences of what they do and highlighting that they have the power to change that cindy its just basic accountability and that doesnt have to be a personal decision that youre a bad person its just making people accountable for the consequences of the things they build and the way that their businesses work i also love that the world needs more wordle and all the various wordles all around i love that as an example of how sometimes we get locked into this mentality that everything that happens online happens on facebook or one of the other giants and heres this tremendous thing that didnt come from there at all and is now expanding and growing and being adopted by communities all around the world for their own purposes quite apart from the tech giants danny corynne mcsherry the legal director at eff is always talking about how everybody pays attention to facebook and forgets that the web were defending is still there still an engine of creativity in empowerment and out of left field i think that while were talking about political action its still true that digital security has become an important first step in protests and maybe thats the thing that leads us on to other considerations from like intellectual property to the importance of encryption all of this stuff is already ingrained in peoples lives so all it takes is pointing out that theyre already taking it seriously we just need to work out a way of making all of those things work for them cindy i love his emphasis on art and how art is one of the ways that we can bring people into an understanding of how theyre impacted by technology but really seize the means of making their art sharing their art talking about their art and appreciating other artists the fan communities as well that these are all people who are already engaged with their technology and so for us as people who are trying to help make a better world we just have to find a way to reach those communities and help empower them to use their voice to make things better danny thank you for listening if you want to get in touch about the show you can write to us atpodcast@efforg check out the eff website to become a member or donate this podcast is

    "massachusetts highest court upholds cell tower dump warrant this blog post was drafted with help from former eff legal intern emma hagemann massachusetts highest court has upheld the collection of mass cell tower data despite recognizing that this data not only provides investigators with highly personal and private information but also has the potential to reveal the locations identities and associations of tens of thousands of individuals the case is commonwealth v perry and in it the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc addressed the constitutionality of tower dumps of cell site location information csli a tower dump occurs when a phone company provides law enforcement with data on all devices that connected with a specific cell tower during a specified period of time because each cell tower covers a particular geographic area police can infer from the data that the device owners were in that area at the time tower dumps can identify hundreds or thousands of phonesor in this case more than 50000 individuals without any one of them ever knowing that he or she was the target of police surveillance in perry after a series of six store robberies and one homicide law enforcement sought and obtained two tower dump warrants together the warrants covered seven cell towers on seven different days over the course of a month officers crossreferenced the tens of thousands of phone numbers they obtained to identify devices that pinged multiple towers on the days the crimes occurred through this process they were able to identify mr perry as a suspect mr perry moved to suppress the evidence eff along with aclu and the massachusetts committee for public counsel services filed an amicus brief in the case arguing that a tower dump is a general search that violates the fourth amendment and article 14 massachusetts constitutional equivalent like the general warrants reviled by the constitutions drafters tower dumps are irremediably overbroad because they sweep up the information of hundreds or thousands of people that have no connection to the crime under investigation these searches lack probable cause because the police cant show a reason to suspect the thousands of innocent people whose information is caught in the dragnet had any link to the crime they also fail constitutional particularity requirements because the scope of the search is not appropriately limited we further argued that even if the court upheld tower dumps it should impose strict minimization requirements as a safeguard against abuse the government must demonstrate that the tower dump is necessary and must delete any device data unrelated to the crime as soon as possible although the court declined to adopt a rule that cell tower dumps are always unconstitutional it didnt preclude such an argument in a future case it recognized that these searches not only allow police to track individuals into private constitutionallyprotected areas and by tracking call data provide police significant insight into the individuals associations they also make it possible for police to piece together peoples patterns of behavior because the police requested tower dumps in multiple areas over the course of multiple days the data not only could establish where an individual was and with whom he or she associated on one occasion but also where the individual had been and with whom the individual had associated on multiple different occasions if a warrant were not sufficiently limited in scopeif it allowed police to select any phone number at random from the 50000 and determine the identity of that individual their location and with whom they had communicatedit would undoubtedly violate constitutional particularity requirements nevertheless the court here held the police had sufficiently limited the scope of the search police had reason to believe the crimes were connected and committed by the same people and police explained in their affidavit supporting the warrant that they had requested multiple tower dumps to look for commonalities among the recordsphone numbers that appeared in more than one location because one of the warrants also established probable cause to believe the suspect had used a phone in commission of the crime the court upheld that warrant the court suppressed the evidence from the other warrant finding it failed to establish these same facts the court did mandate important limitations on these searches going forward these include requiring a judge to issue the warrant and requiring the warrant to include protocols for the prompt and permanent disposal of any data that is not related to the crime under investigation however while these minimization requirements are important overall the result in perry is disappointing requiring only that police state that they intend to identify andor verify commonalities in the data on thousands of people is a low bar perry could also have troubling implications for other dragnet search technologies like geofence warrants the court asserted that the thousands of innocent individuals swept up in a tower dump are not subjected to a search in the constitutional sense because although police collected their data police didnt take the further step of analyzing it like tower dumps geofence warrants allow the government to search the location information of many innocent people to try to identify a suspect several courts have already recognized the mass privacy violations inherent in geofence data dumps regardless of whether any police conduct any analysis on the collected data these courts have ruled geofence warrants are unconstitutional for reasons similar to those we raised in our perry amicus brief and we hope that the supreme judicial court would take a fresh look at these arguments if or when it rules on the constitutionality of geofence warrants we will continue to challenge cell tower dumps geofence warrants and other forms of location surveillance in other cases going forward",
    "patent troll uses ridiculous people finder patent to sue small dating companies finding people near you with shared interests and talking to them has a very long history in human culture were social animals we need to find other people close to us to work together with play games with and build relationships and families with modern online social networks are built on top of those basic human needs the technologies we humans use to do these things are everchanging but the basic concepts arent software that promotes new types of social networking is a terrible fit for the patent system which hands out hundreds of thousands of 20year monopolies each year on inventions that are supposedly new but often arent no one should be able to patent an invention that simply describes a method of finding likeminded people unfortunately that seems to be just what happened with a patent we looked at recently a patent troll called wireless discovery llc sued eight different social and dating apps for patent infringement claiming that they infringe us patent no 9264875 which claims locationbased discovery based on peoples personal attributes wireless discovery which was created just before its patent was granted in 2016 sued eight different online dating apps in april most of them small apps claiming themobile socialworld wireless discovery lawyers say that a simple combination of basic computing services is enough to infringe their patent its claim chart makes it explicit what is required to infringe the 875 patent for its lawsuit against the dating network zoosk the claim chart describes how zoosk has a website that mobile devices can connect to zoosks server collects information from the mobile devices including location and unique device identifiers zoosk users can send and accept invitations to connect with and send messages to each other zoosk shares profile information of connected users who are members of a same social network ie theyre on zoosk zoosk can connect users who are in the immediate vicinity of each other or a particular distance away and thats it the wireless discovery patents were originally filed for a company called ximoxi which tried to market a type of electronic social cards ximoxi founder ramzi alharayeri who is the named inventor on the patent said in a 2012 press release that his software was the first socialdiscoverability application that works on iphone android and blackberry alike in 2016 however the ximoxi website said that the app was still under development it continued after releasing our beta we needed to go back to work for bugs fixes and features improvements today the ximoxi website is defunct not the first the idea of connecting nearby users of a social network isnt an idea that should be patentable at all but its also worth noting thateven if ximoxi executed this concept in some wayit was far from the first the ximoxi patent was filed in 2014 but claims that its a continuation of a patent that was originally filed in october 2008 the time that ximoxi was founded locationbased social networking on mobile devices is quite a bit older than that though it was conceptualized and used well before smartphones were common the new york citybased app dodgeball dates back to 2000 it was acquired by google with plenty of press coverage in 2005 by then it was clear that different types of social mobile apps were going to be taking off a paper presented at the 2006 ieee engineering conference notes the growth of mobile social networking an entire subindustry of the wireless sector is slowly being created as companies such as dodgeball playtxt and smallplanetnet begin to capitalize on this new phase in the mobile technology platform none of this earlier technology was presented to the us patent and trademark office in wireless technologys patent applications unfortunately this is all too common its how many software patents get issuedexaminers have just 18 hours on average to complete the examination and the applicants can come back with endless revisions ultimately persistent applicants get patents even when they dont have a great case for one and those monopolies do serious damage most patent lawsuits filed in the past several years arent disputes that result from a company trying to defend the market for its product rather they are initiated by patent trollscompanies with no products that simply use patents to demand payment from others in 2021 87 percent of hightech patent disputes in federal courts were filed by companies or people that make most of their money from patent licensing its very difficult and expensive to get patents thrown out in court even when the technology described in the patent existed long before the patent was filed thats why 10 years ago congress created a more robust review system for alreadygranted patents called inter partes review or ipr over the years various patent owners have tried to weaken the ipr system encouraging the patent office to reject many iprs on technicalities or even saying iprs are unconstitutional thankfully those efforts have all failed theres a bill in congress that would strengthen ipr closing some of the loopholes that patent owners have used over the years to dodge the ipr process right now passing the restoring america invents act as it was introduced is the best thing we could do to weed bad patents out of the system related documents wireless discovery llc v zoosk complaint wireless discovery llc v zoosk claim chart wireless discovery llc v coffee meets bagel complaint",
    "11th circuits ruling to uphold injunction against floridas social media law is a win amid a growing pack of bad online speech bills theres a lot to like in the 11th circuit court of appeals ruling that much of floridas social media lawthe parts which would prohibit internet platforms from removing or moderating any speech by or about political candidates or by journalistic enterpriseslikely violate the first amendment and should remain on hold the decision is a win for free speech that stands in stark contrast with a 5th circuit court of appeals may 12 ruling allowing a similar constitutionally questionable texas law to go into effect while an emergency application to block the texas law is pending before the supreme court we filed a brief urging the court to put it back on hold we are relieved by the 11th circuits ruling in netchoice v florida the court recognized two crucial first amendment principles flouted by floridas law that platforms are private actors making editorial decisions and that those decisions are inherently expressive when platforms remove or deprioritize posts they are engaging in first amendmentprotected speech the court said tornillo shows the way florida sb 7072 signed into law by gov ron desantis a year ago prohibits large online intermediaries from terminating politicians accounts or taking steps to deprioritize posts by or about them or posts by journalistic enterprises defined to include entities that have sufficient publication and viewership numbers the law would override the sites own content policies florida passed the law to retaliate against platforms for supposedly censoring conservative voices interestingly the 11th circuit noted that the perceived bias in platforms contentmoderation decisions is compelling evidence that those decisions are indeed expressive first amendmentprotected conduct in ruling that the law likely violates the first amendment the 11th circuit pointed to the supreme courts unanimous 1974 ruling in miami herald v tornillo which established that the editorial judgements made by private entities about whether and how to disseminate speech are protected under the constitution in tornillo the court rejected a florida law requiring newspapers to print candidates replies to editorials criticizing them subsequent supreme court rulings protecting decisions by parade organizers and cable operators about what third partycreated content they disseminate further underpinned this free speech principle the 11th circuit said eff and protect democracy filed an amicus brief with the 11th circuit arguing that internet users are best served when the first amendment protects platforms rights to curate speech as they see fit free of government mandates that right allows for a diverse array of forums for users with unique editorial views and community norms the court agreed recognizing that by engaging in this content moderation the platforms develop particular market niches foster different sorts of online communities and promote various values and viewpoints we were pleased to see the threejudge panel use examples we cited in our brief to demonstrate the variety of communities platforms seeks to appeal to through moderating content from facebook which removes or adds warnings to posts it considers hate speech roblox which prohibits bullying and sexual content and vegan forum which allows nonvegans but doesnt tolerate member who promote contrary agendas to proamericaonly which promised users no bsno liberals platforms arent mere hosts or dumb pipes florida argued that sb 7072 doesnt violate the first amendment because platforms dont review most posts before publication and therefore arent making expressive decisions as to user content but the law doesnt target speech that isnt reviewedit is specifically aimed at speech that is removed or deprioritized the court noted the panel also knocked down floridas argument that the law doesnt implicate free speech rights because it only requires platforms to host speech and not necessarily agree with it the court said that unlike the private entitiesshopping centers and law schoolsin the cases cited by the state social media platforms have expression as their core function which is violated by sb 7072 finally the court rejected floridas argument that large social media services are common carriersentities that in the communications context provide facilities so anyone and everyone can communicate messages of their own design and choosing while platforms sometimes say they are open to anyone in practice they have always required users to accept their terms of service and community standards so in reality social media users are not free to speak on the platform in any way they choosethey cant post comments that violate the platform rules the court noted the 11th circuit also cited supreme court precedent in reno v aclu where the high court said internet forums have never been subject to the same regulation and supervision as the broadcast industry further congress excluded computer services like social media companies from the definition of common carrier in the telecommunications act of 1996 florida cant just decide to make social media platforms into common carriers either the 11th circuit said declaring neither law nor logic recognizes government authority to strip an entity of its first amendment right merely by labeling it a common carrier borrowing language from our brief the court said social media platforms have historically exercised editorial judgment by moderating content and a state cant force them to be common carriers without showing theres a compelling reason to strip them of first amendment protections this is important because it recognizes that platforms have curated content since day one the court let stand at least for now sb 7072 provisions requiring platforms to inform users before changing moderation rules give users who request it the number of people who have viewed their posts and give deplatformed users an opportunity to retrieve their data eff had argued and the lower court had ruled that while some of these transparency requirements may be acceptable in another context they were impermissible here as part of sb 7072s overall unconstitutional retaliation the 11th circuit has drawn important lines in the sand but it wont be the last with lawmakers in georgia ohio tennessee and michigan considering similar bills its likely more courts will be called on to decide whether platforms have a first amendment right to moderate content on their sites we hope they follow the 11th circuits lead",
    "california bill would make new broadband networks more expensive the state of california is primed to bring 21stcentury fiber access at affordable rates to every californian last years unanimous passage of sb 156 a historic multibillion investment in broadband means every california community has the resources available to chart a longterm course toward building fiber networks the department of commerces recent national telecommunications information administration ntia proposal to allocate 48 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure bill for building broadband networks also supplements californias efforts by centering affordability and futureproof fiber in its disbursement policy lastly the california public utilities commission cpuc criteria to access federal funding further codifies a commitment toward affordability and fiber infrastructure for all all of these efforts will help bring every californian affordable fiber internet access but a bill in the california legislature threatens to undo all of that good work ab 2749 authored by assemblymember quirksilva would prohibit the cpuc from requiring providers to offer affordable service to all californians and force them to wrongly treat fixed wireless offerings as equivalent to fiber infrastructure it would also place a completely arbitrary 180day review shotclock on the review of applications to federal funding which will shortcircuit public provider efforts to deliver fiber all these provisions run contrary to both the established goals of the biden administration and the newsom administration to deliver affordable futureproof fiber to all ab 2749 has passed the assembly and is now headed to the senate if this billwhich is supported by industry providers like att and frontier communicationswere to pass areas that currently do not even have basic service primarily rural and urban poor areas would suffer most of all ab 2749 cuts off affordability to most californians the cpuc is supposed to provide taxpayerfunded grants to companies that build internet infrastructure the bill prohibits the cpuc from requiring these grantees to offer a service at a fixed price for more than five years the cpuc is also prohibited from setting a specified rate or setting a ceiling for rates the only limited exemption to these bans on affordability are for lowincome households this means a family of four making less than 55000 a year would be protected from broadband price gouging but the vast majority of californians would not put another way at a time of record inflation the californians getting broadband for the first time will be subject to uncontrolled monopoly pricing on infrastructure that their own tax dollars built to fully appreciate how egregiously antiaffordability this bill is however you need to understand one thing the cpucs evaluation criteria for infrastructure grants heavily favors both a 10year price commitment and the creation of a 40 plan at 5020 mbps thats 50 megabits per second for downloads and 20 for uploads this means that the infrastructure built with your taxpayer dollars must provide you at least a 40 service and must maintain that commitment for the first 10 years additionally the cpuc will update and increase the 5020 mbps standard over time as a response to constantly rising needs and the easy scalability of fiber networks ab 2749 says the cpuc cannot require internet service providers to provide a basic service tier and regulate the pricing if it were to pass your taxpayer dollars will pay an internet service providers isps construction costs and then that isp can still charge you high rates on the networks built with your money despite a supermajority of americans viewing broadband access to be as important as water and electricity and having no choice in provider the market is such that you have to grit your teeth and accept the high prices set by monopolistic isps ab 2749 would further entrench this exploitative status quo wireless service is not and will never be equivalent to fiber this bill would also force the state for the purpose of grants to treat wireless offerings on equal terms with fiber infrastructure they are not there is also often an assertion that given lower population density rural areas can be covered at much lower costs by wireless networks than by putting cables in the ground they can not highspeed wireless depends wholly on excess capacity from underlying fiber wireline infrastructure in other words it is impossible to deliver fast wireless without excess multigigabit capacity from the wires in the ground this is why the biden administrations recent guidance to the states emphasizes that states must deploy fiber into rural areas to ensure longterm economic development eff has noted time and again in our research that fiber is the only infrastructure that can be upgraded to achieve the performance needed for decades to come without significant new investment it is low latency highbandwidth and extremely reliable once fiber is built to an area that area can be cheaply reliably and adequately served with futureproofed internet for the next 3070 years it should come as no surprise then that att one of the nations largest wireless providers is supporting a bill that forces the state to treat wireless as the same as fiber ignores the fundamental engineering disparities and takes funding away from building fiber infrastructure to subsidize wireless plans theyd like nothing more than to pad their profits with taxpayer dollars and hamper competition we need to build once and build right not create and impose arbitrary deadlines ab 2749s arbitrary 180day review deadline for all applications to federal funding is yet another attempt to help out big isps if the cpuc does not affirmatively act on the application within this time period it would be approved automatically eff in our work with local providersincluding public and private providersand new entrants find no need for the state to establish a review shot clock these providers arent asking to receive funds more quickly they are more interested in deploying their networks correctly they are undergoing extensive feasibility studies and analyses on how to deliver fiber infrastructure to all californians they want to build once and build right so their communities have the affordable futureproof fiber service they need this arbitrary deadline only benefits those with deep pockets and the resources to flood the cpuc with early applications this unnecessary deadline will only serve to send money to companies such as att without the opportunity for proper deliberate vetting on top of the antifiber and antiaffordability provisionsthis bill will cause the state to squander taxpayer dollars and do very little for broadband access in effect the state would waste our onceinageneration opportunity to build affordable fiber to serve all californians futureproof fiber is expensive and takes time but it will be more expensive and take even longer if we waste valuable resources today on broadband options unsuited for longterm economic development if were going to do it right ab 2749 cannot be passed into law",

remedies are obtained after establishing an intermediarys liabilitywhich ranges from strict faultbased knowledgebased and court adjudicatedliability to total immunity various configurations along this spectrum continue to emerge as regulators experiment with regulatory dials and knobs to craft legislation tailored toward specific contexts the categories introduced in this section should be understood as general concepts as many regulatory frameworks are not clearcut or allow for discretion and flexibility in their application under strict liability regimes online intermediaries are liable for user misconduct without the need for claimants to prove any fault or knowledge of wrongdoing on the part of the intermediary as liability can occur even if the intermediary did absolutely nothing wrong strict liability regimes make intermediaries overly cautious they tend to conduct general monitoring of user content and minimize their exposure to claims by overremoving potentially unlawful material thus strict liability regimes heavily burden online speech by encouraging the intermediaries to censor speech even that which is not harmful faultbased approaches impose liability when the intermediary fails to meet specified due diligence obligations or a particular duty of care for example intermediaries may be obligated to remove certain types of content within a specific time frame andor prevent the reappearance of it the uks draft online safety bill for example imposes duties of care which are pegged to certain broad and potentially subjective notions of harm which are in turn likely to require platforms to engage in general monitoring of user content negligencebased liability as per the uk model takes a systematic approach to content moderation rather than addressing individual pieces of content the required standard of care under such liability approaches can vary on a continuum from negligence as established by the actions of a reasonable person to recklessness a substantial deviation from the reasonable action faultbased liability systems are very likely to effectively require a certain degree of general user monitoring and can lead to systematic overremoval of content or removal of content that may be undesirable but which is otherwise perfectly legal knowledgebased approaches impose liability for infringing content when intermediaries know about illegal content or become aware of illegal behavior knowledgebased liability systems usually operate via notice and takedown systems and thus typically do not require pervasive general monitoring there are different types of notice and takedown systems which vary in design and provide different answers to the question about what constitutes an effective notice what constitutes knowledge on the part of the intermediary is also an important question and not straightforward for example some jurisdictions require that the illegality must be manifest thereby evident to a layperson the eus ecommerce directive is a prominent example of a knowledgebased system intermediaries are exempt from liability unless they know about illegal content or behavior and fail to act against it what matters therefore is what the intermediary actually knows rather than what a provider could or should have known as is the case under negligencebased systems however the eu commissions proposal for a digital services act moved a step away from the eus traditional approach by providing that properly substantiated notices by users automatically give rise to actual knowledge of the notified content hence establishing a constructive knowledge approach platform providers are irrefutably presumed by law to have knowledge about the notified content regardless of whether this is actually the case in the final deal lawmakers agreed that it should be relevant whether a notice allows a diligent provider to identify the illegality of content without a detailed legal examination the manila principles developed by eff and other ngos stress the importance of court adjudication as a minimum global standard for intermediary liability rules under this standard an intermediary cannot be liable unless the material has been fully and finally adjudicated to be illegal and a court has validly ordered its removal it should be up to an impartial judicial authority to determine that the material at issue is unlawful intermediaries should therefore not lose the immunity shield for choosing not to remove content simply because they received a private notification by a user or should they be responsible for knowing of the existence of court orders that have not been presented to them or which do not require them to take specific remediative action only orders by independent courts should require intermediaries to restrict content and any liability imposed on an intermediary must be proportionate and directly correlated to the intermediarys wrongful behavior in failing to appropriately comply with the content restriction order immunity from liability for usergenerated content remains rather uncommon though it results in heightened protections for speech by not calling for greatly incentivizing or effectively requiring the monitoring of user content prior to publication section 230 provides the clearest example of immunitybased approaches in which intermediaries are exempt from some liability for user contentthough it does not extend to immunity violations of federal criminal law intellectual property law or electronic communications privacy law section 230 47 usc § 230 is one of the most important laws protecting free speech and innovation online it removes the burden of prepublication monitoring which is effectively impossible at scale and thus allows sites and services that host usergenerated contentincluding controversial and political speechto exist section 230 thus effectively enables users to share their ideas without having to create their own individual sites or services that would likely have much smaller reach the intermediary liability toolbox typically intermediary liability laws seek to balance three goals preventing harm protecting speech and access to information and encouraging technical innovation and economic growth in order to achieve these goals lawmakers assemble the main components of intermediary laws in different ways these components typically consist of safe harbors notice and takedown systems and due process obligations and terms of service enforcement in addition as daphne keller points out the impact of these laws can be managed by adjusting various regulatory dials and knobs the scope of the law what constitutes knowledge notice and action processes and good samaritan clauses in addition and much to our dismay recent years have seen some governments expand platform obligations to include monitoring or filtering despite concerns about resulting threats to human rights raised by civil society groups and human rights officials lets now take a brief look at the main tools lawmakers have at their disposal when crafting intermediary liability rules safe harbors offer immunity from liability for user content they are typically limited andor conditional for example in the united states section 230 does not apply to federal criminal liability and intellectual property claims the eus knowledgebased approach to liability is an example of a conditional safe harbor if the platform becomes aware of illegal content but fails to remove it immunity is lost most intermediary liability laws refrain from explicitly requiring platforms to proactively monitor for infringing or illegal content not requiring platforms to use automated filter systems or police what users say or share online is considered an important safeguard to users freedom of expression however many bills incentivize the use of filter systems and we have seen some worrying and controversial recent legislative initiatives which require platforms to put in place systematic measures to prevent the dissemination of certain types of content or to proactively act against content that is arguably highly recognizable examples of such regulatory moves will be presented in part three of this blog series while in some jurisdictions platforms are required to act against unlawful content when they become aware of its existence more speechprotective jurisdictions require a court or governmental order for content removals intermediaries often establish their own notice and action procedures when the law does not set out full immunity for usergenerated content under the eus ecommerce directive as well as section 512 of the digital millennium copyright act dmca which even sets out a notice and takedown procedure service providers are expected to remove allegedly unlawful content upon being notified of its existence in exchange for protection from some forms of liability such legal duties often put users freedom of expression at risk platforms tend to behave with extra caution under such regimes often erring on the side of taking down perfectly legal content in order to avoid liability it is far easier and less expensive to simply respond to all notices by removing the content rather than to expend the resources to investigate whether the notice has merit adjudicating the legality of contentwhich is often unclear and requires specific legal competencehas been extremely challenging for platforms intermediaries also exercise moderation by enforcing their own terms of service and community standards disabling access to content that violates their service agreements this is seen as good samaritan efforts to build healthy civil environments on platforms this can also enable pluralism and a diversity of approaches to content moderation provided there is enough market competition for online services platforms tend to design their environments according to their perception of user preference this could entail removing lawful but undesirable content or content that doesnt align with a companys stated moral codes for example facebooks ban on nudity as discourse is shifting in many countries dominant platforms are being recognized for the influential role they play in public life consequently their terms of service are receiving more public and policy attention with countries like india seeking to exercise control over platforms terms of service via due diligence obligations and with the emergence of independent initiatives which aim to gather comprehensive information about how and why social media platforms remove users posts finally the impact of notice and action systems on users human rights can be mitigated or exacerbated by due process provisions procedural safeguards and redress mechanisms when built into platforms notice and action systems can help protect users against erroneous and unfair content removals regulatory dials and knobs for policy makers in addition to developing an intermediary liability law with the different pieces described above regulators also use different dials and knobslegal devices to adjust the effect of the law as desired scope intermediary liability laws can differ widely in scope the scope can be narrowed or expanded to include service providers at the application layer like social media platforms or also internet access providers for example intervention with content does a platform lose immunity when it intervenes in the presentation of content for example via algorithmic recommendation in the us platforms retain immunity when they choose to curate or moderate content in the european union the situation is less clear too much intervention may be deemed as amounting to knowledge and could thus lead to platforms losing immunity knowledge in knowledgebased liability models a safe harbor is tied to intermediaries knowledge about infringing content what constitutes actual knowledge therefore becomes an important regulatory tool when can a service provider be deemed to know about illegal content after a notification from a user after a notification from a trusted source after an injunction by a court broad and narrow definitions of knowledge can have widely different implications for the removal of content and the attribution of liability rules for notice and action in jurisdictions that imply or mandate notice and action regimes it is crucial to ask whether the details of such a mechanism are provided for in law is the process according to which content may be removed narrowly defined or left up to platforms does the law provide for detailed safeguards and redress options different approaches to such questions will lead to widely different applications of intermediary rules and thus widely different effects on users freedom of expression in the next installment well explore recent developments and regulatory proposals from around the globe the other

through obscurity is podcast episode making hope with adam savage transcript pamits not like banking and shopping and its not like banking and shopping online and other things that dont require secrecy and disassociating the identity of the person doing the transaction from the content of the transaction and thats why internet voting is so challenging if you were to send in your ballot from remotely and then call the election official and say hey its pam i sent my ballot i voted for candidate a is that what youve got thats not how elections work first of all but if it were why not just do that and not do the send just say hey i want to vote for candidate a could you mark that down for me that would actually be safer it wouldnt be private but neither is internet voting cindy thats our guest pam smith shes the ceo of verified voting and today shes going to be joining us to explain how digital technologies can help secure elections but we are also going to talk about how we need to keep a clear separation between our actual votes and the internet danny pams going to spread some light and tell us how we can protect the entire process from voter registration to vote verification through to a risk limiting audit shell tell us how to build a system that lets everyone feel comfortable that the candidate with the most votes was actually the one chosen cindy im cindy cohn the executive director of the electronic frontier foundation danny and im danny obrien special advisor to the eff welcome to how to fix the internet the podcast where we explain some of the biggest problems in tech policy and examine the solutions thatll make our lives better cindy hi pam you and i go way back and i currently serve on the board of advisors of verified voting and im so excited to have you here today so we can dig into these things pam its great to be with you again cindy so we find ourselves in a very strange situation you and me and others who care about election integrity where some of the arguments that we have been using for many many years to try to make our elections more secure are being picked up and used by people who i would say dont have that same goal pam well i think people legitimately want to know that elections are righteous why wouldnt they but i think the undermining of the publics ability to trust and to know how to trust in elections is really one of the more severe dangers to democracy today as long as there have been elections there have been problems issues challenges and even tampering with elections thats not new those issues are different at different points in history starts out with who gets the vote and who doesnt but also back in the day communities used hand count votes with the whole public watching and it was very transparent it was low tech no problems but it was also not private not secret and there were very few voters now elections are carried out with software and computerized systems in most aspects of elections and things can be hacked and tampered with and can have failures and bugs and glitches people need to understand technology touches their elections in many places how do we know that its secure so what we do is look at what are the basics in securing elections its the same as securing anything computerized its keeping systems up and running its protecting data from both malfeasance and malfunction and its being able to recover when something goes wrong having that resilience cindy could you give us an example of one of the things that people were very worried about that election officials could easily explain pam well probably the biggest one and this was anticipated was the fact that not all the votes are going to be done being counted on election night theyre just not and especially in 2020 where you add one more layer of complexity called a pandemic so it made a lot of things different when the ballots come in if they came in before election day my county prepares them for counting and runs a tally first thing after the polls are closed they can report out those absentee ballots but those are just the ones theyve already gotten in thats not the polling place ballots thats not the ones we allow to arrive late as long as they were postmarked on time so theres many more ballots to be added into that count thats just the initial count i think people dont know that the initial count is not the official count and thats important to know it takes a while for all of the ballots to be processed and counted even to make sure that they were legitimate ballots and included properly in the count and that end part is called certification of the election when we certify in each jurisdiction thats the final count cindy and this is the difference between elections in the united states in elections in a lot of places around the world we vote on a lot of things danny its true cindy and we have complicated ballots that might change across the street depending on what precinct or whatever that youre in even in a place where people live very close together there are different kinds of ballots because people are voting for their very local representative as well as all the way up to the federal level and elections are generally governed as a legal matter locally as well so the us constitution guarantees your right to vote but how that happens varies a lot one of the things that verified voting created a long time ago but which i still think is a tremendously useful tool is something called the verifier which is a website that you can go to and type in where you live and it will tell you exactly what counting technologies are used danny and i think this touches on the key point here how technology can complicate or even undermine peoples trust in what is already a very complicated system again a lot of the conversations in the last election were about has this been hacked and how do we prove whether it has or it hasnt been hacked i know verified voting and eff were very involved in the early effort to require paper records a paper trail of digital voting technology what we call voter verified paper records back in the 2000s so can you just talk a little bit about where the role paper of all things plays in a more high tech voting system pam its interesting to note when we got started back in 2004 there were only about eight states with a requirement to use paper and only about three had a requirement to check the paper later with an audit danny and when you say paper here its literally a printout you vote and then theres a paper record somewhere that you voted in a certain way pam its a physical record that you get to check to make sure it was marked the way you intended it danny got it pam you may be using an interface a machine that prints that out but you may be marking a physical ballot by hand as well and its that physical record of your intent that is the evidence for the election so heres the thing about paper you need to know that you can cast an effective ballot and that means youre getting the right ballot that its complete theres no missing candidates or contests on it its feasible to mark if you have to use an interface that that interface is working up and running and that you have a way to check that physical ballot and cast it safely and privately then that ballot gets counted along with all the other ballots and you need a way to know it was counted correctly and that you can demonstrate that fact to the public to the satisfaction of those who are on the side of the losing candidate or issue and thats the key if you have that this is what was said about the 2020 elections chris kreb who was at the cybersecurity agency at dhs on elections and he called the 2020 election the most secure in american history the leg he had to stand on for that was the fact that almost all jurisdictions were using paper that almost all jurisdictions were doing some audit to check after fact and thats why it matters you have to have that record danny i know that some of the work thats come out of what youve been doing then has been this idea of risk limiting audits im addressing this to both of you because i know you both worked on this but the risk limiting audits and how they work pam audits get done in a variety of industries there are audits in banking theres all kinds of audits the irs might audit you its not always seen as such an attractive word but in elections its really important what it means is you are counting youre doing a hand to eye count youre visually looking at those paper ballots and doing a comparison of a count of a portion of those ballots with the machine count so software can go wrong it can be badly programmed it could have been tampered with but if you have that physical record that you can then count a portion of and check and make sure its matching up and if its not figure out where the problem is thats what makes the system resilient a risk limiting audit is one that relies on the margin of victory to determine how much you have to count in order to have a strong sense of confidence that youre not seating the wrong person in office so its a little bit like polling if you poll on a particular topic you want to know how the public feels about something you dont have to ask every single person you just ask a percentage of them you make sure its a good cross section you make sure its a well randomized sample and all other things being equal youre going to know how people feel about that topic without having to ask every single person and with risk limiting audits its the same kind of science its using a statistical method to determine how much to count cindy we worked really hard to try to make sure that there was paper and then we realized that we had to work really hard to make sure that the paper played the role that it needed to play when there are concerns if you only do this when youre worried that theres a problem youre really not fixing the situation it needs to be something that happens every time so people can build their trust in the things but also it needed to be lightweight enough that you could do it every single time and you dont end up with these crazy debacles like we saw in arizona can you give us an update hows it going trying to get risk limiting audits regularized in the law i know this is an area where you guys do a lot of work pam well this extremely geeky term risk limiting audits is actually getting wide traction so its good news danny good pam people i think are understanding it and one of the things that we do is support election officials through the process so maybe their state passes a law that says youll do risk limiting audits we help them understand how to do it and answer all the questions that might come up when theyre doing it they then use that to demonstrate to the public that its working right and its a tool that they are really adapting to and adopting well theres more to do and i think whats important to know is that really any audit is going to have some utility in telling you how your equipments working risk limiting audits are a more robust form of auditing and they will let you not do as much work if the margin is wide and they will call for more work if the margin is very narrow but you want that anyway you might go to a full recount in a very tight margin talking about florida 2000 that margin would probably necessitate that full hand recount anyway but doing a risk limiting audit you can get to that kind of confidence danny how to fix the internet is supported by the alfred p sloan foundations program in public understanding of science enriching peoples lives through a keener appreciation of our increasingly technological world and portraying the complex humanity of scientists engineers and mathematicians cindy let me flip to where i love to go which is so what does it look like if we get this right what are the values what does it look like if we have a world in which we have technology in the right places in our systems but also that we can trust it pam i think that getting it right means that voters know the election was fair because it was conducted securely and they know how to know that that they know where the ground truth is and how to figure it out that theyre participating actively in watching that theyre not being hindered by failed technology at whatever point that intersects with the election whether its registration or checking into the polling place or actually using a device to mark your ballot or the counting process that nowhere along on the path theyre being hindered in that process and that means more people can participate who want to participate this doesnt address things like voter suppression thats a separate different issue and its an issue about security because elections really are only secure if everybody who wants to gets to participate and can cast an effective ballot cindy could you explain why we want to fix the internet we want to make the world better and why voting over the internet isnt on the list of things that we think would make a better world pam one of the things that we talked about is the importance of the paper that the voter gets to check at the time theyre voting and make sure it represents what they meant to vote for when you use the internet to transmit votes you lose that what arrives at the elections office if it arrives at the elections office may or may not represent what the voter thought they intended to vote for and theres no real way to control for of that right now maybe in some future on a different internet that was designed for security and not just for open communication its possible to do but you have all kinds of issues with internet voting that include things like voter authentication attacks malware on the voters devices not just in the elections office a denial of service attack server penetration spoofing all kinds of things can go wrong cindy and ballot privacy is tremendously important if you really want to make sure that people can vote freely for who they want you dont want them subjected to either their boss or the other people who live with them or their community being able to see how they vote thats not a free vote that can often be a coerced vote so a secret ballot is just a piece of how elections work not just in the us but in most places of the world for really good reason pam the internet has other ways in which its hazardous to elections health it can be used for attacks on election officials which were seeing a lot these days attacks on votes attacks on voters registration we saw in 2016 state databases being tampered with from afar and other kinds of information hacks just really by way of disinformation attacks on democracy and understanding how to know what you need to know if were thinking of about what would the world look like if we got it right election officials are protected votes are secure and voter registration is secure and theres ways for people to check and make sure of that and fail safes in case something happens last minute so all of those kinds of things are really important fighting disinformation is probably as important as the rest danny i thought it was very fascinating in the last couple of elections in the us i was talking to the cybersecurity side of all of this its very difficult to get to the bottom of these things but one thing really stuck with me which is that the officials i was talking to said well look most peoples model of this is someone is hacking to change the results to favor a particular person but in fact if you want to introduce instability into a country the best thing you can do is just undermine faith in the system itself you dont actually have to achieve a result you just have to inject a sufficient amount of ambiguity into the result because once that trust is gone then it doesnt matter what the result is because the other side is going to assume something happened behind the scenes so is part of this to make the whole system transparent in a way that the average person can understand whats going on pamwe dont expect voters to have confidence our mission has never been make voters feel confident its not about that its about giving them justified confidence that the outcome was right and thats different cindybut lets just say i hear that theres a problem in a critical place what do i ask myself and what do i look for to be able to tell whether this is a real problem or perhaps not a real problem thats being overblown or just misunderstood pam well i think you want to know what the election official says there are rare exceptions but nearly all the election officials i know theyre simply heroes frankly theyre working with minimal budgets and doing very long hours on very tight deadlines that are unforgiving but what they do is really to address problems anticipate problems avoid them and if they come up address them so you need to know what the election official is saying if its observable go observe if theres a count happening that you can watch go watch that count but you cant get your information from somebodys cousin on facebook cindy give us an example of where there was a concern and we were able to put it to rest or there was a concern and it went forward pam one of the things wed hear on election day at election protection was wed get a call from somewhere and theyd say ive marked my ballot and i wanted to go cast it in this scanner like i usually do but they told me not to and they put it in a separate bin why did they do that are they taking those ballots away are those not going to be counted whats happening there and we are able to tell them that there is actually a legit reason for that what happens sometimes in a ballot scanner is that the bin gets full that the ballots dont fall in a straight line and it may be jammed and if its jammed you dont want the ballots to get destroyed by trying to keep feeding more and more in that bin has actually got a name its the auxiliary bin its the extra bin for when this happens and it is attached to the ballot box and what happens is once they clear that jam which they may not be able to do in the middle of the busiest time of voting is to feed those through danny all right pam that actually is a real simple problem with a simple resolution but when you can tell people this is how that works it puts their mind at rest danny which brings me i think to something else that people often both on the left and right worry about which is the companies behind these machines how can we reassure people that there isnt something being underhand in the very design of the technologies pam we used to say that it shouldnt matter if the devil himself designed your voting system as long as theres paper and youre doing a robust check on the paper you should be able to solve for that thats what makes it resilient and thats why we want to make sure every voter not just 90 or more but all of the voters are living in a jurisdiction where that paper record is there for them to check cindy i just think overall this is technology it needs to be subjected to the same things we do in other technology to try to continue to make it better and that includes a funding stream so that when new technology is available local election officials can actually get it pam elections are woefully underfunded and theres a conference that happens in california every year thats called new laws this is a conference that election officials hold so that they can examine all the new laws that have been passed that affect how they run elections it happens every year so they are constantly and continuously having to update what they do and make changes to what they do oftentimes there are unfunded mandates that have to do with what they do asking them to do additional things is hard especially if youre not going to pay for it so its really important that there is federal funding for elections that gets down through to the states and to the counties to support good technology but with things like internet voting the most dangerous form of voting that doesnt have to go through any certification because no ones been able quite yet to write standards for how you would do this securely cindy because you cant right now pam because you cant cindy with our current internet pam not that we dont want to you just cant danny i have one more thing to throw in which people often often say oh we should do it like this id love to know your opinion on it because our community is often like well we need an open source voting machine or a voting system and that would fix a set of problems certainly the idea is that would be more transparent and you would feel more confident about it do you think thats an answer or part of the answer pam i think its a very good thing its what some people might call necessary but not sufficient you still are going to need to do audits youre still are going to need paper you still need a resilient system but open source helps make sure that you can anticipate some of the issues right away because there are lots of eyes on the problem with voting technology though it gets tricky its not quite the same as other kinds of open source because whos responsible for whats the most current iteration this isnt something that people can just keep applying fixes to randomly there has to be a known version thats being used in a particular election so there has to be an organization or entity that governs how thats being used cindy understanding how this technology works is tremendously important for all of our security and its the classic security through obscurity doesnt work that our friend adam savage just reminded us of this this is a whole other wing of secure elections but the only way you know something is secure is that a bunch of smart people have tried to break it and they cant pam dont leave weak spots if you can help it because if somebodys looking to tamper theyre going to find the weakest point so it really is crucial to try and secure all parts of our elections danny whats the end game here youre clearly deeply in the trenches trying to incrementally improve these systems but do you ever have a dream where you envisage a world where maybe we do have a solution to voting on the internet or we do use a new technology to make things better pam moving towards those options includes things like if you need to vote by mail you can vote by mail if you want to vote in person in a polling place thats available to you if you need an accessible device one thats really really accessible and usable its available to you and it works and it was set up before you got there so its readily available i think knowing that every jurisdiction is using a system thats resilient to any kind of failure hurricane power outage anything that theres a physical ballot to mark that its easy to check its a usable ballot not confusing so that you end up missing contest or anything like that its designed well ballot design is really important all of those small pieces are only possible if theres enough funding for elections if we believe in our democracy and we believe in having good elections then that means having good voting systems good practices and the resources to carry those out right now election officials really struggle to recruit enough poll workers for every election of course that got a little harder with the pandemic going on many poll workers are of an older age cohort so we need younger poll workers and a lot of really smart programs have led to recruiting high school students to be poll workers and its been magical so i think really getting everyone engaged getting everyone to understand where they can find the ground truth about elections and feeling the confidence that they need to really happily participate and celebrate being part of this democracy thats the most important thing and thats what i envision for our future cindy thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us this has been a fascinating conversation theres so much talk about elections and election integrity right now and its great to have a sane stable voice thats been here for a long time which is you and verified voting on the case so thanks pam thank you cindy and thank you danny thanks for doing this dannyits always good to talk to somebody like pam who has years of experience especially when a topic is suddenly as controversial or in the public eye as election integrity i did think given how controversial it is these days pam was reassuringly genial she established that we need to get to a ground truth that everyone can agree on and we need to find ways technological or not to reassure voters that whatever the result the rules were followed cindy i especially appreciated the conversation about risk limiting audits as one of the tools that help us feel assured that the right person won the election the right issue won the election especially that these need to be regularized eff is audited lots of organizations are audited that this is just somewhat built into the way we do elections so that the trust comes from the idea that were not doing anything special here we always do audits and we scale them up depending on how close the election is and thats just one of the pieces of building trust that i think verified voting has really spearheaded the other thing i really liked was the ways that she helped us think about what we need to do when we hear those rumors of terrible things happening in elections far away i appreciated that you start with the people who are there look for the election officials and the organizations who are actually on the ground in the place where you hear the rumors about looking to them first but also looking to the election protection orgs of which verified voting is one but not nearly the only one that are really working year round and working in a nonpartisan way around election integrity danny and another leg of the stool is transparency throughout all of this process its key for resolving the ambiguity of it i do appreciate that she pointed out that while open source code is great for giving some element of transparency its necessary but not sufficient you have to wrap it around a trusted system you cant just solve this by waving the free software license wand all over it cindy i also appreciate pam lifting up the two sides of thinking about the internets involvement in our elections first of all the things that its good at delivering information making sure ballots get to people but also what its not good for which is actual voting and the fact that we cant get ground truth in internet voting right now and that part of the reason we cant and what makes this different than doing your banking online is the need for ballot secrecy that has a tremendously long and important role in our elections danny but that said i do think that ultimately there was a positive thread going through all of this that many things in this area in the united states have got better we have better machines we have newer machines we have less secrecy and proprietary barriers around those machines often people when we ask them about what their vision of the future is they get a little bit thrown because it is hard to describe the positive side but pam was pretty specific but also pointed out perhaps why its such a challenge because she highlighted that what we want in our future is a diversity of solutions and of course that you need the correct financial and social support in the rest of society to make that vision happen cindy thanks so much to pam smith for joining us and

    "dojs new cfaa policy is a good start but does not go far enough to protect security researchers the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa the notoriously vague antihacking law is long overdue for major reform among many problems the cfaa has been used to target security researchers whose work uncovering software vulnerabilities frequently irritates corporations and us attorneys the department of justice doj today announced a new policy under which it will not bring cfaa prosecutions against those engaged solely in good faith security research its an important step forward that the doj recognizes the invaluable contribution security research plays in strengthening the security of messaging and social media applications financial systems and other digital systems used by hundreds of millions of people every day but its new policy which is only an agreement for the doj to exercise restraint falls far short of protecting security researchers from overzealous threats prosecutions and the cfaas disproportionally harsh prison sentences we still need comprehensive legislative reform to address the harms of this dangerous law in part dojs policy change is forced by the supreme courts ruling last year in van buren v us which provided clarification of the meaning of exceeding authorized access under the cfaa the law makes it a crime to intentionally access[] a computer without authorization or exceed[] authorized access and thereby obtain[] information from any protected computer but does not define what authorization means previously the law had been interpreted to allow criminal charges against individuals for violating a websites terms of service or violating an employers computer use policy leading to criminal charges that have nothing to do with hacking in van buren the supreme court cut back on that interpretation holding that the defendant did not exceed authorized access when he obtained information he was entitled to search for work purposes but used that information for other nonapproved activities the new doj policy adopts this interpretationas it mustbut like the supreme court it stops far short of requiring that a defendant defeat a technological restriction in order to exceed authorized access that would do more to protect security researchers journalists and others whose work requires accessing computers in ways that contravene terms of service or go against the wishes of the computer owner instead of this clear line the new policy explicitly names scenarios in which written policies may give rise to a criminal cfaa charge such as when an employee violates a contract that puts certain files off limits in all situations or when an outsider receives a ceaseanddesist cds letter informing them that their access is now unauthorized weve seen companies like facebook and linkedin abuse the cfaa in exactly that waysending cds to researchers and journalists whose access they dont like regardless of the merit of these private disputes it is unacceptable to give these tech companies discretion to turn their far less powerful adversaries into potential federal criminals the new doj policy also promises more than it delivers in its exemption from prosecution for security research it limits the exemption to research conducted solely in good faith which could leave out a lot of how security research happens in the real world that word solely leaves open to interpretation whether hackers who discover and disclose a vulnerability so that it can be fixed but also get paid speak at a security conference like def con or have other secondary motivations can still be prosecuted moreover the policy adopts the definition of good faith security research put forth by the copyright office in its triennial rulemaking about the digital millennium copyright act dmca section 1201 which purports to provide an exemption for good faith security testing including using technological means but that exemption is both too narrow and too vague the dmca prohibits providing technologies tools or services to the public that circumvent technological protection measures to access copyrighted software without the permission of the software owner to avoid violating the dmca any tools used must be for the sole purpose of security testing with additional limitations interpreted at the governments discretion like the dmcas language the doj policy fails to provide concrete detailed provisions to prevent the cfaa from being misused to prosecute beneficial and important online activity the cfaa should protect security researchers and give them incentives to continue their vital work security researchers should not have to fear that their work protecting all of us from flaws in computer systems in cars electronic voting systems and medical devices like insulin pumps and pacemakers are going to land them prison the dojs policy simply does not go far enough to prevent this as an agency policy the dojs new rules do not bind courts and can be rescinded at any time such as by a future administration and it does nothing to lessen the risk of frivolous or overbroad cfaa civil litigation against security researchers journalists and innovators nor does it address the threats posed by state antihacking laws some of which are even more overbroad than the cfaa itself the policy is a good start but it is no substitute for comprehensive cfaa reform whether by congress or by the courts in continuing the work of van buren to narrow its reach related casesvan buren v united states",
    "two of perus top isps improve transparency practices while two competitors lag behind new hiperderechos report shows perus top two telecom operators movistar telefónica and claro américa móvil continued to earn high marks for being transparent about government requests for user data while competitors bitel viettel and entel slightly improved practices promoting human rights but in general lagged behind according to a new report issued today from digital rights group hiperderecho hiperderechos new ¿quién defiende tus datos who defends your data report launched today reveals disparities in data protection and privacy practices among perus four leading internet service providers isps movistar came out slightly ahead in the new report after tying with claro for the top position in the reports last edition except for the user notification category movistar received full credit in all other evaluated parameters even though all four companiesbitel claro entel and movistarhave improved their marks since the first edition in 2015 the disparities in the latest results are evident in four out of eight evaluated categories bitel and entel received no credit highlighting their lack of transparency regarding government requests for getting access to user personal data only movistar and claro received scores for publishing information about government requests for user data disclosing guidelines they follow when responding to such requests explicitly committing to require judicial orders before handing user data to authorities and disclosing practices for notifying users about such government requests the report also looked at companies privacy policies digital security practices and human rights policies in those categories all four companies earned at least partial scores this report the fourth evaluating perus major telecom operators included a new category whether telecom companies make available webpages contracts andor privacy policies in native languages like quechua and aymara as hiperderechos report highlights [w]e consider this to be of utmost importance because there is no free and informed consent if the information presented regarding the processing of personal data is not in an understandable language main findings publishing privacy policies is already a steady practice among evaluated isps all earned full scores in the last two reports they publish privacydata protection policies that apply to their telecommunication services not only to their apps or communication channels disclosing in simple and clear language what information they collect for how long and instances when they share data with third parties movistar stands out for a transparency center on its website that presents the information in a more helpful and attractive way as for publishing more detailed guidelines on how they handle government requests for user data both claro and movistar received full scores in contrast bitel and entel dont disclose any guidelines for the first time movistar went beyond publishing its global policies and published guidelines relating to peru claro had done so already in the last report back then and this year claros published guidelines earned a full star claro discloses applicable norms for lifting telecommunications secrecy competent authorities to issue data requests requirements they should follow and the isp procedure for processing government demands the guidelines mention norms that include communications content and metadata both companies also explicitly commit to requiring a judicial order before handing user data to government authorities with transparent law enforcement guidelines claro and movistar disclose more than vague statements that they may hand user data to comply with legal requirements those vague statements are all that hiperderecho could find in bitel and entel policies again only claro and movistar publish transparency reports about government requests for user data telefónica movistar has been publishing annual transparency reports since 2016 but the company only recently made the reports available on movistar perus website in turn claro improved its practices since last edition and earned a full star for disclosing more details about the requests received like the requesting authorities and the reason for the request for criminal or other matters and the type of crime under investigation claros transparency report also shows the number of government requests for location data in real time as per legislative decree 1182 which requires subsequent judicial review instead of a previous judicial order hiperderechos report notes that in 2021 legislators expanded the cases in which authorities can access user data under ld 1182 before the legislative change authorities could access user data under ld 1182 only in cases where a crime was in the process of being committed flagrante delicto cases now they also cover preliminary investigations of a significant range of crimes such as illegal mining and crimes against public administration shedding light on those requests is all the more important given their invasive nature and the lack of a previous judicial order requirement as for committing to notify users about data demands claro does so for labor civil and family casesa key advance since the last report however both claro and movistar still refuse to notify users in criminal cases claro claims that the prosecutors office directs the investigation and therefore should determine the proper moment to notify in turn movistar argues that perus criminal procedure code limits companies ability to notify hiperderecho holds a different understanding defending user notification as a best practice companies should adopt in any case the report grants a partial score when companies publicly explain their practices relating to user notification even if they explain the reason for not carrying it out claro fell short however in the native language category while bitel almost received a full star bitel provides a service channel in quechua aymara ashaninka and shipiboconibo in turn claro provides contracts and policies in quechua movistar received the best score for having both service channels and contracts in native languages hiperderechos peru ¿quién defiende tus datos series of reports is part of a regionwide initiative inspired by effs who has your back project aimed at encouraging companies to be more transparent and better protect user privacy to garner a competitive advantage in latin america and spain although companies with the largestmarket share like claro and movistar in peru may have more resources to attain a leadership position other ¿quién defiende tus datos reports have shown that smaller operators can work to meet or even outperform the larger players perus bitel and entel should follow suit and do better next time",
    "platform liability trends around the globe from safe harbors to increased responsibility this is the first installment in a fourpart blog series surveying global intermediary liability laws you can read additional posts here platform liability trends around the globe taxonomy and tools of intermediary liability platform liability trends around the globe recent noteworthy developments the vast majority of internet users around the world interact with online intermediariesincluding internet service providers isps search engines and social media platformson a regular basis these companies play an essential role in enabling access to information and connecting people across the globe and are major drivers of economic growth and innovation therefore the policies that intermediaries adopt to govern online marketplaces and platforms significantly shape users social economic and political lives such policies have major implications for users fundamental rights including freedom of expression freedom of association and the right to privacy the increasingly powerful role of intermediaries in modern society has prompted a host of policy concerns one key policy challenge is defining online intermediaries legal liability for harms caused by content generated or shared byor activities carried out bytheir users or other third parties we are concerned by the growing number of governments around the world that are embracing heavyhanded approaches to intermediary regulation policymakers today not only expect platforms to detect and remove illegal content but are increasingly calling on platforms to take down legal but undesirable or harmful content as well recent government proposals to address harmful content are dangerously misguided and will inevitably result in the censorship of all kinds of lawful and valuable expression harsher liability laws for online intermediaries encourage platforms to affirmatively monitor how users behave filter and check users content and remove or locally filter anything that is controversial objectionable or potentially illegal to avoid legal responsibility examples of such proposals will be discussed in part three of this blog series faced with expansive and vague moderation obligations little time for analysis and major legal consequences if they guess wrong companies inevitably overcensor stricter regulation of and moderation by platforms also results in selfcensorship as users try to to avoid negative repercussions for their artistic and political expression and without legal protection service providers easily become targets for governments corporations and bad actors who want to target and silence users the next few years will be decisive for the core rules that govern much of todays internet in this light we offer up this fourpart blog series entitled platform liability trends around the globe to help navigate the jungle that is global intermediary liability regulation we begin by providing some background information and exploring global shifts in approaches to intermediary liability laws in part two well unpack different approaches to intermediary liability as well as explore some regulatory dials and knobs that are available to policymakers part three will take a look at some new developments taking place around the world finally in part four well dig into effs perspective and provide some recommendations as we consider the future of global intermediary liability policy a brief history of intermediary liability rules lets start with a brief outline of intermediary liability laws the political context that gave rise to them as well as todays changing political discourses surrounding them generally intermediary liability laws deal with the legal responsibility of online service providers for harms caused by content created or shared by users or other third parties most intermediary liability regulations share one core function to shield intermediaries from legal liability arising from content posted by users the exact scope of this immunity or safe harbor varies across jurisdictions as will be discussed later in this series these laws acknowledge the important role online service providers play in the exercise of fundamental rights in todays society the need to create specific liability rules became apparent in the 1990s as internet platforms were increasingly sued for harms caused by their users actions and speech this trend of targeting internet intermediaries led to a host of problems from increasing the risks associated with investing in the fledgling internet economy to legal uncertainty for users and businesses and the fragmentation of legal regimes across countries and regions trying to counterbalance this trend lawmakers around the globe introduced safe harbors and other liability limitations for internet intermediaries in protecting intermediaries from liability safe harbor laws pursue three goals 1 to encourage economic activity and innovation 2 to protect internet users freedom of speech and 3 to encourage intermediaries to tackle illegal content and to take actions to prevent harm a shift in tonefrom liability exemptions to responsibility these goals are still highly relevant even though todays online environment is different from the one for which the early regulations were enacted today a handful of companies are dominant global players on the internet and have become ecosystems unto themselves there are many potential responses to the dominance of big tech at eff we have long advocated for interoperability and data portability as part of the answer to outsized market power liability exemptions are not a gift to big tech rather they ensure that users can share speech and content over the internet using a variety of services nevertheless some consider liability exemptions as giving an unfair advantage to the dominant platforms political discourse has also moved on in important ways internet intermediariesand especially social media networksare spaces where a considerable amount of public discourse occurs and often play a role in shaping discourse themselves in recent years major global events have catapulted social media platforms into the limelight of the publics attention including foreign interference in the 2016 us presidential election the cambridge analytica scandal the ethnic cleansing of rohingyas in myanmar the 2018 christchurch mosque shootings and the spread of misinformation threatening the integrity of elections in countries like brazil india and the united states as a result of the widespread perception by both the public and policymakers that companies responses to recurring problems like misinformation cyberbullying and online hate speech have been insufficient online intermediaries are under increased scrutiny this techlash has thus given rise to calls for new and harsher rules for online intermediaries recent accountability debates have shifted the focus towards platforms assumed obligations based on moral or ethical arguments concerning the public role of online intermediaries in a democratic society rather than focusing on a utility or welfarebased approach to liability limitations policymakers are increasingly moving towards a discourse of responsibility because so many people rely on them to communicate with each other and because they appear so powerful online platformsand in particular social media servicesare increasingly viewed as gatekeepers who have a responsibility towards the public good this expectation of intermediaries to respond to current cultural or social norms has led to two related policy responses both centering on the need of platforms to take on more responsibility an increasing reliance on corporate social responsibility and other forms of selfintervention by intermediaries and a greater push for legally requiring platforms to establish proper governance structures and effectively tackle user misconduct some suggestions center on the need for users platforms to take more effective voluntary actions against harmful content and adopt moderation frameworks that are consistent with human rights still more aggressive and dangerous policy responses consider upload filters and proactive monitoring obligations as a solution eff has long worked to provide guidance in response to shifting norms around this topic in 2015 we as part of an international coalition helped launch the manila principles on internet liability a framework of baseline safeguards and best practices based on international human rights instruments and other international legal frameworks in 2018 eff and partners then launched the santa clara principles on transparency and accountability in content moderation which call on intermediaries to voluntarily adopt better practices in 2021 a new version of the principles was developed with a focus on adequately addressing fundamental inequities in platforms due process and transparency practices for different communities and in different markets for this revision the santa clara principles coalition initiated an open call for comments from a broad range of global stakeholders feedback was received from allies in over forty countries and the second iteration of the santa clara principles was launched in december 2021 the current political climate toward intermediary regulation and changing market conditions could lead to a shift in the basic ideas on which current safe harbor regimes are based we at eff believe this may turn out to be a slippery slope w e fear the consequence of stricter liability regimes could be the loss of safe harbors for internet intermediaries reshaping intermediaries behavior in ways that ultimately harm freedom of expression and other rights for internet users around the world these themes will be explored in more detail in subsequent blogs as part of this fourpart series platform liability trends around the globe many thanks to former eff mercator fellow svea windwehr who conducted a first analysis about platform regulatory trends and former

    "we finally have a federal fiber broadband plan there is a lot to appreciate in the recently published notice of funding opportunity nofo by the department of commerces national telecommunications information administration ntia it is arguably the first federal government proposal that seeks to promote infrastructure policies focused on the future rather than the usual subsidizing good enough for now access that means that the american government or at least part of it finally recognizes what appears obvious that the future of internet access is in fiber the nofo contains a strong emphasis on the deployment of openaccess infrastructure designed to facilitate competition and meet the growing needs of communities lastly it promotes affordability key priority outcome of the many projects that will get financed with federal tax dollars lets dive into the details here infrastructure that will last decades congress was explicit in the bipartisan infrastructure law that it did not want the ntia to implement a program that built broadband access solutions that would only be good enough for today and unprepared for tomorrow learning from past federal policy failures that squandered billions of federal dollars on outdated broadband infrastructure that will need to be replaced entirely congress emphasized a priority on projects that can easily scale speeds over time while meeting evolving connectivity needs and support deployment of 5g and other advanced services under section 60102a1i of the bill > i priority broadband project the term priority broadband project means a project designed to i provider broadband service that meets speed latency reliability consistency in quality of service and related criteria as the assistant secretary shall determine and ii ensure that the network built by the project can easily scale speeds over time to i meet the evolving connectivity needs of households and businesses and ii support the deployment of 5g successor wireless technologies and other advanced services in our filing to the ntia eff provided technical analysis explaining how fiberoptic wires meet these objectives laid out by congress and where alternatives fall short in one or more of the above categories this wasnt because of any type of favoritism towards on lastmile transmission medium over another this was just plain old physics driving these results in its explanation of the priority broadband project the ntia agreed and acknowledged that only endtoend fiber on page 42 of the nofo will meet these policy objectives as a result states will need to draft plans with the understanding that pushing fiber deep into communities seeking access should be the overall objective of state broadband plans with rare exception that exception namely defined by an extremely high cost per location threshold page 13 of the nofo will allow nonfiber alternatives to be considered in areas determined to be costprohibitive to deploy fiber optics however states should understand that there is a lot of data now showing that we can basically deploy fiber to the home anywhere weve been able to deploy electricity in fact because the demand and value of broadband is sky high with people at the same level as water and electricity that demand results in the ability for local communities to long term finance the same way rural electrification was done in the past it may shock a number of state policymakers that 21stcentury fiber can actually be a reality for so many people for years they were told by lobbyists working for the big isps such as att and comcast that getting nearly everyone connected to fast multigigabit fiber was impossible what they actually mean is its impossible only for the big isps that arent willing to make longterm commitments to communities over shortterm profit in other words they refused to spend money to make money choosing instead to exhaust their infrastructure and consumer choice but policymakers have to make a decision here on whether the wall streetdriven threetofiveyear return on investment formula is worth more than long term infrastructure solutions that will actually cost the taxpayer much less money in the end people will always need access to the internet going forward and that need will continue to grow without slowing down open access to promote competition and maximum value for public investment eff funded and published a study on how to get everyone connected to fiber infrastructure in the most efficient way possible to find that openaccess fiber infrastructure was key in specific entities that just build the infrastructure to provide access to broadband providers and other users as opposed to selling broadband themselves were better suited to reaching more americans with lower subsidies than the traditional method of subsidizing broadband companies this is because fiber allows the aggregation of data needs in ways other methods of broadband access lack and due to that flexibility to meet multiple different kinds of needs the infrastructure will be better capable of capturing local revenues the added benefit is that once those wires are laid and are open for multiple uses anyone with enough technical knowledge and a small amount of resources could open a small local isp and sell quality services effs research also found that pure infrastructure providers were more willing to adopt longerterm profit strategies in recognition of the value of fiber as an asset which allows them to assess risk differently than a traditional vertically integrated broadband provider it is why you are seeing private market actors willing to deploy a lot more fiber than the traditional isp and for rural local government entities fully commit to fibering up all of their residents with open access infrastructure it is because they can look at the wires in isolation of services see its capacity to meet infrastructure needs for decades potentially as long as 70 years and rationally rely on very longterm financing vehicles much in the same way people purchase houses with mortgages the ntia appears in agreement with these efficiencies and asked states to seek out ways to promote open access infrastructure providers to participate in the program as a means to maximize the impact of the federal investment if every state is able to replicate what is happening in utah where an openaccess infrastructure provider delivering access to a dozen isps is constantly growing due to local demand for the network and that local demand more than pays for the network itself allowing it to constantly grow until everyone is connected to fiber then infrastructure policy will have not only closed the digital divide but vastly improved the competitive landscape for broadband affordability sits at the heart of ntias guidance in many areas these infrastructure dollars are going to provide for the first time broadband access which means it will be a monopoly simply due to the lack of alternatives recognizing the value of the access point and the potential for exploitation the ntia details on page 66 of the nofo that it expects states to adopt strong affordability provisions for all users not just lowincome users given that the taxpayer is actually a major payer in the infrastructure that is being deployed it is logical for the government to set in place rules to protect the public there is also something to be said about how much internet users can trust some companies in broadband access when the current market has given americans some of the most expensive broadband access in the world while sadly one of the slowest infrastructures as the advanced asian countries and the eu transition towards multigigabit all fiber access well ahead of the united states california has already embarked on establishing lowcost access as a priority for its infrastructure program and much like the ntias proposal has prioritized applicants who will commit to offering affordable access to broadband as states develop their own plans a key factor is the level of subsidization that will be provided should factor significantly in how low the price should be for access the biggest price tag is the onetime sunk cost of constructing the network itself whereas actual operation of the network costs are relatively low particular with fiber networks if the taxpayer is taking on the most expensive portion of deployment that means the pressure on paying for the network is alleviated in a significant way balancing out these factors and how that plays into what should be a deliverable outcome from a ntiastate infrastructure plan will require a lot of work as cost model analyst experts such as former chief of the fccs office of strategic planning paul de sa detailed in a recent white paper but it is absolutely necessary in order to avoid unjustly enriching a recipient of this onceinageneration investment in internet access what happens next the ball mostly moves now into the states and territories that have to signal an intention to apply for funding and develop fiveyear action plans given the emphasis on fiber infrastructure states will need to update their local policies to maximize their capability to deliver on 21stcentury access to all people that will include removing barriers to public sector infrastructure providers who can tackle the most difficult areas to provide service as well as explore ways to promote efficiencies like alabama did by merging the interests of deploying fiber by electric utilities and isps through joint ventures every state will undoubtedly seek its own path that fits its needs but now they have a partner in the ntia who can provide technical assistance and resources in ways that were absent in the past for years eff stated the united states desperately needed a fiber for all plan citing the data showing increased monopolization by cable lack of preparedness to meet future needs and general trend of international competitors such as china the ntia has delivered a thoughtful detailed proposal to the states and territories that chart the course to connect everyone to fiber now you must go to your local elected officials to push them to see this vision through",
    "new surveillance transparency report documents an urgent need for change the us intelligence community ic has released its annual statistical transparency report disclosing the use of national security surveillance laws for the year 2021and to no ones surprise it documents the wideranging overreach of intelligence agencies and the continued misuse of surveillance authorities to spy on millions of americans specifically the report chronicles how section 702 an amendment to the foriegn intelligence surveillance act fisa that authorizes the us government to engage in mass surveillance of foreign targets communications is still being abused by the federal bureau of investigation fbi to spy on americans without a warrant specifically the report reveals that between december 2020 and november 2021 the fbi queried the data of potentially more than 3000000 us persons without a warrant although section 702 is intended to facilitate the surveillance of foreign people who are the targets of national security investigations the collection of all of that data from us telecommunications and internet providers results in the incidental capture of conversations involving a huge number of people in the united states but this data isnt incidental to the programs operation at all as the transparency report shows each agencys targeting and minimization rules allow access to americans communications caught in the 702 dragnet and based on the staggering number of times the fbi searches the 702 database using queries related to individual americans 702 has become a routine part of the bureaus law enforcement mission the ic lobbied for section 702 as a tool for national security outside the borders of the us but at its core is instead the ability to conduct domestic warrantless surveillance on americans including for runofthemill crimes this is the governments favorite feature of section 702its not a bug the good news is that congress will again have the opportunity to address this massive warrantless surveillance program the authorities for section 702 are scheduled to sunset if they are not legislatively renewed by the end of 2023 this means lawmakers have a chance to end the many years of overreach by the intelligence community and close warrantless backdoor access to our data the fbi has a wide range of investigatory tools the bureau and other members of the ic will try to scare lawmakers by giving a rundown of all of the crises that could be averted by maintaining its backdoor but have never been required to adequately demonstrate for the public record that 702 fills a gap that could not be replicated through other investigatory tools in 2020 congress let section 215 of the patriot act expire for similar reasons the tools it provided were invasive illegal and did not produce information that could not be acquired with other insidious tools this new surveillance transparency report should only serve to remind us that these programs have existed and flourished far too long in the shadows of the ics secrecy with the potential renewal of section 702 on the horizon its time lawmakers stepped up to close this backdoor access to data law enforcement once and for all",

these tools its about how we conceptualize our role within society and within these different types of spaces like the criminal legal space and saying what do we think is the thing that we would like to see what should our society look like what would a just system look like what would a more equitable community look like in anything in academic spaces and research spaces and just broadly and say what will we need to do to get there and sometimes what we need to do is to step back and say i think that im not going to be helpful and so im going to not try to center myself sometimes its building things that will challenge things that weve already built or that will challenge other communities and other times its just being good community members and just showing up it could literally save lives cindy thats our guest rediet abebe rediet is a researcher and professor of computer science at uc berkeley where shes working on how to make the results of machine learning processes more actionable and more equitable danny shes also the cofounder of black in ai and md4sg thats mechanism design for social good shes going to shine a light on the way forward cindy im cindy cohn effs executive director danny and im danny obrien welcome to how to fix the internet a podcast of the electronic frontier foundation cindy welcome rediet rediet thank you for having me cindy rediet you spent a lot of time thinking about how machine learning works in the real world and how we can make sure that were using it for good purposes and not bad could you give us some of the examples of some of the good uses of machine learning that youve identified and then we can unpack what goes into that rediet decisions that you make as lets say a researcher in how you understand social problems and how you choose to formulate them as machine learning problems or algorithm problems and how you then choose to work on it and whatever outcome you have how you choose to deploy that and so the same set of techniques could be used to do a lot of good or a lot of harm a lot of my research these days is now really focused on taking the machine learning pipeline that we traditionally have within this community and expanding it also taking responsibility for stages of that pipeline that are considered often outside of our scope of responsibility which include translating social problems into the types of research problems that we would typically work with machine learning problems but then also taking the output and thinking critically about how that gets translated into practice into some intervention what impact it might have on communities and so a lot of the work that im doing is critically examining that from both a technical perspective but just also from a practice perspective and saying that we should be expanding the pipeline cindy were fixing the internet now we can certainly talk about the problems but id like to start with the things where things go if we did it right or where have we done it right rediet we have this large scale project that involves examining the use of machine learning in education so rather than diving into build tools which of course were also working on we also wanted to do a survey a holistic survey and analysis of how machine learning is used in education and we identified education experts and we sat with them and we talked through the papers with them we were like this papers goal is to lets say predict student dropout and the goal there would be not just to predict it but also to hopefully do something about it so that students are not dropping out of schools and so thats an admirable goal thats a goal that all of us can get behind but that problem has to be concretely formulated into some machine learning problem and then you have to find the right data set and all that and then now you have this prediction that youre doing around which students are going to drop out and hopefully you get to translate that into some real world intervention so just taking this student dropout risk example we had this interview with someone at a large state university that also struggles a lot with student dropout one of the things that they mentioned was okay this paper is predicting which students are likely to drop out what can we do with that you tell me that some student is at high risk of dropping out thats terrible but in some sense the deed is done at that point you tell a student hey youre at high risk of dropping out thats not necessarily useful to the student and you tell the schools the students dropping out it doesnt necessarily tell them what can you do about it and so what he said was something subtle but i really appreciated he said instead of predicting what students are going to drop out why dont you predict for instance which students are likely to miss class they were already missed some number of classes and maybe theyre about to miss a third class or something we know that if students are missing several classes thats a sign that they might be at risk of dropping out but missing classes is a more actionable thing we can tell students hey ive noticed that youve been missing a lot of classes im worried that youre going to miss more classes what can we do here to support you to attend class the point here is more subtle its saying you have your target variable that target variable could be dropout or it could be something actionable like missing classes and the second thing is something that they can more easily do something about the latter not as clear danny the giant machine comes up with a bleeps and says this person is more likely to drop out but it doesnt give you strong clues about how it came to that decision and in many ways i mean this is an obvious example i guess but if kids are missing school and thats something that system has learned is an early indicator of that its better to know that what its learned than to have it as this opaque machine that just claims that these people are doomed rediet if i tell you for instance that students race is a partial explainer for dropout theres nothing you can do about that thats a fixed thing whereas student missing classes being an issue maybe there is something you can do about it it showed me in some sense that if we were working on these problems in a more bottom up way you go to a university that has a lot of dropout issues you talk to educators there and other staff supporting students and you get a sense of what it is that they notice in the students in some sense they can just give you the problem or you can collaboratively participatory form the problem rather than as machine learning people deciding what we want to solve and then after weve solved it hoping thats what they wanted us to solve danny to what degree do you think that this is a problem thats located in machine learning and the nature of i know computer science or this part of computer science and how much is it just related to the societal fact that people doing research or building these systems are often quite distant and quite uninvolved with people rediet a lot of research communities with this gap that exists for instance you can take health this is one space where weve made a lot of advances in improving health outcomes for people but not for everyone so weve made very few advances for health issues that impact black people trans individuals you name it like marginalized communities and so this gap definitely exists in other spaces but there is also something special to the machine learning ai space as well it is a powerful set of technologies that are being built there are a lot of resources that we have in machine learning and ai that is in some ways really unprecedented theres a lot of organizations that are invested in it and the other thing is also the field is one of the least diverse fields out there i mean thats just the fact you can look at graduation patterns in undergraduate degrees in graduate degrees you can look at the faculty composition we have i think in computer science in the us among the phd granting institutions theres something like over 5000 faculty and of those fewer than a hundred of them are black and something like fewer than 20 of them are black women thats just one example you look at native american its like in the single digits and so it is a very homogenous community as it stands right now things are slightly improving theres a really really long way to go and so as long as our field our research field continues to not be representative of the society that were trying to impact youre going to continue to have these gaps and these gaps are going to show up in our papers and sometimes they show up in more subtle ways and other times they show up in not so subtle ways and so i think these issues around thinking about the community culture and who gets to be part of the community is really tightly integrated and intertwined with our research itself cindy i love this example im wondering is there another one are there other places where you see how we could do it better in ways that are actually either happening or within the pipeline rediet yes right now were actually focused a lot on understanding policy public policy and where things might be going wrong so just to give you one concrete example right now a lot of decisions around which services are going to be allocated to what individuals are made based off of measurements like the official poverty measurement in the us and this official poverty measurement was something that was originally proposed by an economist mollie orshansky back in the sixties so this was over 50 years ago it was really meant to be almost a proof of concept a placeholder not meant to be something that generally applied and she even explicitly says we should not be generally applying it and were using it almost unchanged outside of maybe inflation 50 years later danny wow rediet as time has gone on things are getting harder and harder for a lot of communities and so there are many people who are by any reasonable definition struggling but this official poverty measurement might not necessarily pick up so you end up in situations where someone is really in need of services and you use this very coarse extremely outdated measurement and you cant necessarily detect it in that way one of the things that we are looking at is that theres a lot of evidence that predicting bad life outcomes like lets say poverty is hard and were seeing that okay part of the reason might be that the way that we measure poverty itself is very ill defined its extremely outdated if you have an official poverty measurement that is so low that it cant actually even reliably detect a lot of people were struggling then does it actually matter what youre predicting here and so in some ways were using these machine learning techniques and these kinds of results like predicting life outcomes is hard to really challenge public policy and to say hey the way that were measuring this thing is actually not good we think danny in situations like that how do you know that you are doing better do you anticipate a way that people could learn to change that and challenge that in the way you are challenging these earlier measurements rediet we all are feeding in value into these systems theres no neutral value and so in some sense what were doing here is to say the knee jerk machine learning researcher reaction here may have been you get some data youre excited about the data youre like what can i predict here and one of the things that you can predict is poverty you are like great im going to try to predict poverty and of course that assumes a lot of things like as i mentioned that the way were measuring poverty is accurate or reasonable or useful and thats a huge huge assumption that youre making there and so what we did here is to challenge that in many ways so the first thing is rather than just taking things as given we were like okay why is this a measure of poverty lets go back to the literature in the public policy and sociology and economic space and understand what conversations are happening there and there you notice that there is actually very robust conversation happening around how we should be measuring poverty theres alternatives that have been proposed like the supplemental poverty measurement which captures a whole host of other things like material hardship that you might be facing are you able to pay your utilities are you able to pay your rent that stuff this is not something that you can necessarily always capture using peoples income and so these are conversations that if you stayed within the more traditional machine learning space you might not necessarily be exposed to unless you happen to be dealing with it as a person yourself and so were challenging that by saying hey listen we dont have to take things as given we can go back and see what the debates are that are happening out there out in other fields out in communities out in policy spaces and see how we can potentially contribute to that cindy it does feel sometimes like people who love machine learning are running around with this hammer trying to make everything into a nail ive got this cool system its great it can do stuff that feels like magic plus its fun for me to work on so let me start looking around for things that i can use it for and what i hear you saying is we really need to flip that around we need to start with the people who are on the ground what their problems are and then make sure that the things that were doing are actually giving them actionable steps cindy in addition to making sure that the things were using machine learning and algorithmic training techniques on are the good things i think that theres all a strain of concern that there are things that we shouldnt be using these systems on at all i know youve thought about that as well rediet we have this large scale project were working on focused on statistical software used in the criminal legal systemits used at pretrial investigation prosecution posttrial and weve been especially interested in machine learning as physical software used as evidence so these are cases is where you could have something like a probabilistic genotyping software that could be used on samples that are found from crime scenes and used to convict people we really need to have a serious conversation on the machine learning side about what tools should even be used as evidence because thats a really high bar danny how does that happen whats the process by which a machine learning approach or a system is put in place and that leads to the wrongful conviction of a person rediet it could happen in several ways so one is just even before youre brought to trial youre not brought to trial just randomly you dont pick up a random person off the street and youre like youre on trial today theres a lot of things that happen and a lot of statistical and machine learning tools that are used up until that point to identify the person im putting that in quotations to make all sorts of decisions theres also just the fact that in the us we have incredible inequality and discrimination that surfaces in many different ways including in what we criminalize so i think thats also important context to keep in mind but what were focused on in this project is specifically in software used as evidence so this is someones on trial for some something and theres just a set of evidence that i now get to present as a prosecution team and say this is why i think this person may have committed this crime and thats used in discussions and to make a decision around whether you think that and committed the crime or not and sometimes that can be like a person i could say oh i know i totally saw danny walking down the street at this hour or something and you get to question me cross examine me and say is your eyesight good have you updated your prescription any number of things and so what happens is that i as a prosecutor get to just like use some software that has not been properly validated that its now spitting some number and we have to use that as evidence and the defense might not necessarily have the ability to cross examine that and i get to bring witnesses like the ceo of the organization to say oh the software is actually awesome let me tell you bunch of things danny it has the force of some scientific fact so someone will stand up and say this shows that theres a one in a million chance that this isnt the defendant and people believe that but they cant challenge it and the defense doesnt have the technical expertise to say yes but if his sister also touched it wouldnt that change the thing i see danny how to fix the internet is supported by the alfred p sloan foundations program in public understanding of science enriching peoples lives through a keener appreciation of our increasingly technological world and portraying the complex humanity of scientists engineers and mathematicians cindy eff has done a bunch of these probabilistic genome cases and working with people in this and so the theres a threshold level problem that often the company will claim a trade secret in how the technology works which means that defense doesnt have access to it at all the second thing is that they will often point to papers about how great their system is that were written just by them weve managed in a couple of cases to get access to the actual systems and have found horrific problems in them that theyre not actually very good and that theres a finger on the scale on things and sometimes its just that its poorly designed not that anybody has evil intent theres supposed to be a standard in the law called the daubert standard that make sure that technologies that are introduced in cases have been vetted and honestly its not being followed at the level of rigor that is needed right now rediet this is precisely what we are what were working on and this is a joint project with a lot of amazing people including angela zhen and john miller who are graduate students here at berkeley and rebecca wexler who was an intern at eff and is a close collaborator of mine and ludwig schmidt and moritz hart also so what were working on here is precisely what you mentioned you have this daubert standard that would be followed in a lot of different cases but in statistical and the use of statistical software used as evidence i think right now its just not happening i think and it in the same way that if someone was a witness and goes up to the stand and says a bunch of things and youre able to cross examine them you should also have that ability with the statistical software and currently we dont actually have a framework for doing that the legal system the us is meant to have these two sides one of which is meant to prove innocence and the other is meant to prove guilt and the idea is that in a situation where these two sides are equally resourced and all that stuff then maybe youre able to go about this truth seeking process in a more reliable way but thats not what we have right now theres an massive massive imbalance you have defense counsel who dont have time who dont have resources who dont have the energy to be able to challenge whatever the prosecution puts on the table and then what next this is completely unjust and you end up having a lot of people wrongfully convicted for crime they didnt commit and were not doing anything about it cindy i think its tremendously important and i think its also helpful to judges i think judges often feel like rediet absolutely cindy they are skeptical or at least they want to be sure that theyre relying on good evidence but they dont have the tools to know what they dont know rediet absolutely cindy so i think that this is great for the defense but its also i think going to be helpful to the courts in general rediet absolutely cindy to be able to have a way to think about im being presented this information how much rely how should i rediet reason cindy yeah rediet theres just a lot of different ways we could be involved so one of the things that is happening in this organization called pd query its by dana yow whos a law student here at berkeley i think shes graduated now so pd query matches public defenders with graduate students with technical training to do work thats maybe even more straightforward for us but could be really really useful but you could really imagine scaling this up and doing something even bigger so one of the things that we could do now is to write cross examining questions that helps the defense side you could write affidavits you could write maybe even more generic way to file affidavits that could be signed by experts in their respective areas so you could have for the probabilistic genotyping software you could have a computer science professor and someone in population genetics saying hey this is what we understand about the tools and these are the concerns that we have about them please proceed with caution if you it in these types of situations i think theres just so much the machine community could do both in this more as like community members saying we have expertise so we can just try to help people these are things that will literally save lives i mean people are put on death row for this they will literally save communities and families and avoid wrongful convictions and challenge our unjust system as it exists cindy it hurts a lot of people it hurts the defendants but it also hurts the other people who might be hurt by the person who really needed to go to jail who didnt go to jail so the whole endeavor of criminal justice is aided by truth and thats what these interventions are rediet and may i add one more thing can i just add one more thing i think one other common misconception im just assuming i have the ears of some people and im like really trying to pitch something but one more thing i want to mention is i think an unspoken sometimes i guess it is spoken assumption is that when youre working in this area that its technically less challenging and let me tell you i have never been more challenged than i have been in the past two years technically honestly when i started graduate school and i was doing stuff that was a lot more standard because i was like i want to get an academic job so im just not going to rock the boat so when i was doing stuff that was more standard it was just i mean it was fun but it was a lot more simple this is a space that is challenging in so many different ways danny i can see how youre getting involved in connecting these dots is through creating your own institutions and organizations and so lets talk a little bit about black in ai and also mechanism design for social good rediet mechanism design for social good was started as a graduate student reading group in 2016 it was eight of us there was a very small group of people and we were just trying to read stuff and understand where we could be useful with the set of techniques that we had and now fast forward i wont tell you the whole story but fast forward to now its this much broader community its thousands of people in hundreds of different countries and institutions and the scope is also broader danny has the organization or your perceptions of the problems changed as its become more global rediet theres so many instances of this so one of the things that came out of this community is this larger project we have on data practices primarily in africa here in the us theres obvious issues in data sharing but weve gotten a lot of things under control if youre thinking in the lets say ethiopian context where im from ive seen situations where data has been shared that really should not be shared there was no data sharing agreement it included peoples personally identifying information and it just passed around a lot of data generated in the continent ends up to the benefit of those based outside of the continent and especially those with no connections with the continent and so you have situations where literally those who collected the data and whose data is being collected dont have ownership rights over the data and are not even able to buy it like everyone else would you have situations like right now were focused on open data which of course open software but data this is stuff that we get excited about but theres some irony here when you make something open thats not necessarily equitable it favors people like myself who have the ability to go and work with that data to work with the complexities of the data who have a lot of compute power and so thats not actually equitable either so you could still end up in a situation where open data of communities that are not given the resources could continue to just shut them out so its not necessarily open in the sense that we would like to think that it is so lots of things that you could miss here that really shape how i understand the data economy in various parts of the world danny this is something that i spent some time tracking at eff because it was a huge concern because what i felt was that essentially that there were some countries and some regions that were being used as guinea pigs for both data collection and data application rediet its very disappointing and super common i mean its incredibly common and the common pattern that you observe here is that its again this gap that i mentioned to you between those who are building something doing research whatever it is and the people actually affected by it because they just talk to people and you talk to people in such a way that they feel empowered theyll let you know whats going to work and whats not going to work and theres just so many things that you could get wrong its not just even the data collection even if we were to agree on the data set theres even concepts like privacy for instance that mean different things in different parts of the world cindy give us a picture what if we what if we got this all right rediet shut off the internet for a bit lets all take a break and just come back in a year cindy we need to reboot it danny just close it down for repairs cindy lets say that i mean because i think that youve identified so many important pieces of a better world like this looking at the whole pipeline of things looking talking the people who are impacted making sure the people are impacted just get told whats happening and so lets say we got all those things right what values would we be embracing what would be different about the world rediet so i dont have the answers which is good i dont think anyone has the answers but i have some things that i would start with so one of the things is that right now a lot of what happens on the internet is profit driven in many ways you can see how this primary goal being profit maximization being at the root of a lot of things that are going wrong and so thats one thing thats going wrong and so that of course brings up questions around like monopolies it brings up questions around what kinds of regulations should we be putting in place these are not technical questions but these are incredibly important questions that if you dont resolve theres nothing that we can do here that will create a long lasting impact so thats one thing and then instead you have to decide okay what are the other values that we should be putting in what are the things that we should be potentially maximizing for and there again i dont think theres going to be a universal answer i think that we have to embrace that different communities will need different things and so you have to figure out a way to move to more decentralized framework where like one single entity does not get to impact billions of people in the way that it is now unless we are able to figure out a way in which people are empowered everyone is empowered and especially those who are marginalized because when youre marginalized its not like were all starting from the same place its that like the marginalized person is more things have gone wrong for them that is what that means and so we really have to focus on those communities and ways to empower those communities and so we really need to think about how we can create that first and then from there good things will happen cindy its important to note when things are getting better but i dont think you have to say that things are getting better in order to try to envision a place where they are better too many people who i talk to really think that were theres no better vision at all and so we want to give that better vision because i dont think you can build a better world unless you can envision a better world and we can be frank and brutal that were not even headed toward that in some ways were headed against it in some places and i think thats absolutely true why we celebrate our victories we have to recognize that not everything is headed in the right direction rediet and i appreciate what youre saying here about just being able to articulate our vision for what a better world might be to ourselves i think and also and to do so precisely to be as precise as we can and then also to one another so we can have a conversation about it as well so i appreciate that cindy thank you so much for coming theres such a rich conversation about how do we really rethink how we do machine learning and algorithmic decision making and i thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us rediet thank you so much cindy and danny cindy well that was a fascinating conversation i really appreciate how she thinks about making sure machine learning gives actionable information that we go beyond just the can we predict something and i think shes right that sometimes we actually cant predict something when we think we can but more importantly that our predictions need to move into actionable information and the difference between just telling an educator that a students at risk for dropping out versus telling the educator you need to watch for how many times they miss the class those are two different inquiries and recognizing the difference between the two of them is really important danny these are challenges about applying new academic or computer science techniques into the real world that have already existed i love the story about the as she was doing the investigation into how people measure poverty that she realized that she found the embers of a 1960s research project that have been taken far too seriously and even the researchers then were trying to signal that this was tentative and not perfect and again it spreads out i think that sometimes its not the sin of machine learning but the things that it reifies or the data it sucks in the stories of the hunger for data meaning that people stop considering about the privacy of data or the communities that theyre drawing from is an important lesson cindy shes deep into developing tools to help us get it right using machine learning in some instances to try to help alleviate the problems that machine learning is causing and i think of the paper that theyre writing about how to evaluate dna evidence developing the systems to help the courts and advocates figure out whether that thing is working well so in some ways weve got machine learning interrogating other machine learning and i think thats fabulous thats how we end at the balance where we think were getting things more right danny rediet as i think a key figure doing this pitch to the machine learning community themselves to do the work to make things better it was flattering that she thought though we are one of the podcasts they listened to but also nice to know that this isnt the boring work cindy its not just the coding its not the time when youre training up the model or the model is spitting out the results its actually looking all the way from what problems are you trying to solve are you defining the problems in a way that is actionable and then what happens on the other side what data are you feeding in but then what happens on the other side of the actionable things being spit out are they able to be implemented and then how does it fit into the whole storyi think that one of the things that shes helping do is breaking machine learning out of this silo that its just about the tech and also breaking the pattern where the people doing machine learning dont look like all of the people who are impacted by their doing the black in ai and the other systems that shes building really trying to make sure that we grow the number of people who are using these systems and developing these systems to better match the way that theyre being used in the rest of the world danny well thanks again to rediet abebe thank you for joining us on how

    "california law enforcement now needs approval for militarygrade surveillance equipment well be watching california residents finally have a law designed to dismantle some of the secrecy around domestic acquisitions of warzone surveillance equipment the weapons of the united states militarydrones mobile command centers sound cannons and morehave been handed off to local law enforcement for years the transfers have equipped police departments with the ability to redirect surveillance tools and the weapons of war designed for foreign adversaries toward oftenfaultless targets on us soil for police departments getting the gear the process is often secretive if you dont think your local law enforcement really needs an aerial surveillance system or for that matter an mrap mineresistant ambush protected vehicle there hasnt been too much you can do to stop these from joining the arsenal at your neighborhood police department ab 481 a new california state law went into effect at the beginning of may 2022 for equipment already in agencies possession and at the beginning of this year for new technologies it requires democratic control of whether california state or local law enforcement agencies can obtain or use militarygrade tools whether they are received from the federal government purchased or utilized via some other channel through their elected officials the public can say no to military surveillance and other technology and it wont be allowed to come to town ab 481 requires democratic control of whether california state or local law enforcement agencies can obtain or use militarygrade tools regardless of how its obtained these democratic control measures include the creation of draft use policies that must be publicly posted an opportunity for residents to organize and be heard and a vote by the governing body at a public meeting if the proposal is approved the police then must provide regular reports on how the equipment has been used and the public body must perform annual compliance reviews the bill also mandates that agencies already in possession of military equipment obtain approval from the governing body by the end of 2022 or else stop using them ab 481 is modeled on community control of police surveillance ccops laws adopted in 18 communities across the country it was sponsored by the the womens foundation of california womens policy institute alliance for boys and men of color and the stop terror and oppression by police stop coalition where ccops ensures democratic control over local acquisition and use of all manner of surveillance technologies ab 481 ensures democratic control over local acquisition and use of military technologies including military surveillance technologies in california there are more than 500 local law enforcement agencies and the state is one of the biggest recipients of military transfers in all the federal program to transfer surplus military wares has moved more than 75 billion worth of equipment to local law enforcement since the programs inception in 1990 military equipment for the purposes of the new law encompasses a broad range of weapons and surveillance tools drones and unmanned vehicles of both the land and sky command control vehicles trucks equipped with computers and other equipment to collect and transmit various video and information feeds tanks mraps mineresistant ambushprotected vehicles and humvees weaponized vehicles of any kind firearms of greater than 50 caliber taser shockwaves and lrads longrange acoustic devices also known as sound canons and projectile launchers it is important for there to be more transparency into law enforcement practices and for communities to have democratic control of surplus military transfers particularly for hightech surveillance equipment the enactment of ab 481 is an important step forward it is important for there to bemore transparencyinto law enforcement practices and for communities to havedemocratic control of surplus military transfers particularly for hightech surveillance equipment the proposed military equipment use policy is now the first step of the process for agencies trying to get military gear this is a publicly available written document that would govern the state or local agencys use of this military equipment it needs to do a few things address the legal rules governing the use of the equipment outline the training required and describe the procedure by which the public can make complaints a law enforcement agency then needs to get the approval of the jurisdictions governing body like the city council in the form of a public meeting the policy and other relevant materials need to be made available to the public on the agencies website at least 30 days in advance residents who oppose the military equipment can use that month to organize in opposition once approval is granted the agency isnt just free to use the equipment indefinitely there will be an annual review for compliance with the use policy based on an annual military equipment report that report needs to contain the quantity possessed for each type of military equipment a summary of how and for what purpose the military equipment was used a summary of any complaints or concerns received concerning the military equipment the results of any internal audits any information about violations of the use policy and the consequences the total annual cost for each type of military equipment including acquisition personnel training transportation maintenance storage upgrade and other ongoing costs and from what source funds will be drawn the following year and the quantity sought for each type of additional military equipment the law enforcement agency intends to acquire in the next year agencies have started posting their materials online like these from milpitas and the california department of corrections and rehabilitation unfortunately there have been rumblings from some in law enforcement against the need to disclose whether they have wargrade equipment as weve seen in our compliance review of sb 978 which requires california police departments to post their policies online adherence to new accountability measures cant be taken for granted still whether they like it or not ab 481 makes hiding militarygrade tools against the law for law enforcement",

    "how to disable ad id tracking on ios and android and why you should do it now the ad identifier aka idfa on ios or aaid on android is the key that enables most thirdparty tracking on mobile devices disabling it will make it substantially harder for advertisers and data brokers to track and profile you and will limit the amount of your personal information up for sale this post explains the history of device ad identifiers and how they have enabled persistent tracking identification and other privacy invasions but first things first heres how to revoke tracker access to your ad id right now on android open the settings app and navigate to privacy > ads tap delete advertising id then tap it again on the next page to confirm this will prevent any app on your phone from accessing it in the future the android opt out is available on android 12 but may not available on older versions instead you can reset your ad id and ask apps not to track you as below source on ios apple requires apps to ask permission before they can access your idfa when you install a new app it may ask you for permission to track you source select ask app not to track to deny it idfa access to see which apps you have previously granted access to go to settings > privacy > tracking the menu should look like this here you can disable tracking for individual apps that have previously received permission only apps that have permission to track you will be able to access your idfa you can set the allow apps to request to track switch to the off position the slider is to the left and the background is gray this will prevent apps from asking to track in the future if you have granted apps permission to track you in the past this will prompt you to ask those apps to stop tracking as well you also have the option to grant or revoke tracking access on a perapp basis apple has its own targeted advertising system separate from the thirdparty tracking it enables with idfa to disable it navigate to settings > privacy > apple advertising source set the personalized ads switch to the off position to disable apples ad targeting history in the early days of smartphones trackers used static device identifiers the unique device identifier udid on ios and the android id on android to track users across apps these identifiers were unique permanent and were frequently accessed by third parties without user knowledge or consent this was rightfully considered a problem for user privacy a 2010 investigation by the wall street journal exposed the extent of the issue and in 2011 after a series of probing questions from us members of congress apple began restricting access to the udid the industry had already begun to rely on data collection tied to udid and trackers scrambled to adapt to the change then in 2012 apple quietly introduced the identifier for advertisers idfa idfa was almost identical to the udid it replaced it was a globally unique identifier that was available to all apps by default the biggest difference was that idfa could be reset though this was only possible if users knew what to look for apple also allowed users to enable a setting called limit ad tracking this sent a signal to apps asking them not to track but it did not actually affect the apps ability to access idfa android followed suit in 2013 introducing the android advertising identifier aaid like apple google made its identifier available to all apps by default without any special permission it also allowed users to reset their ad identifier but not restrict access to it or delete it in 2016 apple updated limit ad tracking to set the idfa to a string of zeroes effectively deleting it this meant that for the first time users had an effective technical optout of idfa tracking in 2021 apple introduced app tracking transparency att which requires apps to get affirmative consent before they can track users with idfa or any other identifier this had an enormous impact on the tracking industry while previously about 20 of users chose to opt out of tracking meaning 4 out of 5 were opted in after the change the vast majority of users have chosen not to allow tracking defaults matter meanwhile android finally started rolling out a way for users to disable their ad idas of april 1 2022 android also requires developers to request a separate permission in order to access the ad id however this is treated as a normal permission meaning users dont see any popup asking for their consent despite the ad ids central role in enabling thirdparty tracking the developer documents explain that this kind of permission is for data that presents very little risk to the users privacy in other words androids ad id is still exposed on an optout basis and users have to go out of their way to defend their privacy on the platform in february google also indicated that it may eventually phase out the ad id altogether it plans to bring a version of the privacy sandbox framework to mobile devices to support behavioral advertising without reliance on crossapp identifiers but google assured developers that it wont change anything substantial about the ad id for at least two years why it matters the ad identifier is a string of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies your phone tablet or other smart device it exists for one purpose to help companies track you thirdparty trackers collect data via the apps on your device the ad id lets them link data from different sources to one identity you in addition since every app and tracker sees the same id it lets data brokers compare notes about you broker a can buy data from broker b then use the ad identifier to link those two datasets together simply the ad id is the key that enables a whole range of privacy harms invasive 3rdparty profiling by facebook and google pseudoscientific psychographic targeting by political consultants like cambridge analytica and location tracking by the us military sometimes participants in the data pipeline will argue that the ad id is anonymous or pseudoanonymous not personally identifying information and imply that it does not pose a serious privacy threat this is not true in practice first the ad id is commonly used to help collect data that is obviously personally identifiable like granular location data if you can see where a person works sleeps studies socializes worships and seeks medical care you dont need their email address to help identify them and second an entire industry exists to help trackers link ad ids to more directly identifying information like email addresses and phone numbers in a vacuum the ad id may be anonymous but in the context of the tracking industry it is a ubiquitous and effective identifier disabling this id makes it substantially harder for most advertisers and data brokers to track you these industries process data from millions or billions of users every day and they rely on convenient technologies like the ad id to make that kind of scale possible removing this tool from their toolbox will result in substantially less data that can be associated with you in the wild it is not only beneficial to your privacy it also makes the surveillance advertising industry less profitable and dont take our word for it facebook has said that apples app tracking transparency feature would decrease the companys 2022 sales by about 10 billion but although its a good first step removing your ad id wont stop all tracking if you are concerned about a specific privacyrelated threat to yourself or someone you know see our other resources including digital security and privacy tips for those involved in abortion access you can also check out effs guides to surveillance selfdefense

    "what companies can do now to protect digital rights in a postroe world the increasing risk that the supreme court will overturn federal constitutional abortion protections has refocused attention on the role digital service providers of all kinds play in facilitating access to health information education and careand the data they collect in return in a postroe world service providers can expect a raft of subpoenas and warrants seeking user data that could be employed to prosecute abortion seekers providers and helpers they can also expect pressure to aggressively police the use of their services to provide information that may be classified in many states as facilitating a crime whatever your position on reproductive rights this is a frightening prospect for data privacy and online expression thats the bad news the good news is there is a lot companiesfrom isps to app developers to platforms and beyondcan do right now to prepare for that future and those steps will benefit all users if your product or service might be used to target people seeking offering or facilitating abortion access now is the time to minimize the harm that can be done heres some ideas to get you started if you build it they will comeso dont build it dont keep it dismantle what you can and keep it secure many users dont truly realize how much data is collected about them by multiple entities as they go about their daily business search engines isps apps and social media platforms collect all kinds of data including highly sensitive information sometimes they need that data to provide the service the user wants too often however they use it for other purposes like ad sales andor for selling to third parties sometimes theyll claim the data is anonymized but often thats not possible for example theres no such thing as anonymous location data data points like where a person sleeps at night or spends their days are an easy way to find a persons home address or job a malicious observer can easily connect these movements to identify a person and anticipate their routines and movement another piece of the puzzle is the ad id another socalled anonymous label that identifies a device apps share ad ids with third parties and an entire industry of identity resolution companies can readily link ad ids to real people at scale governments and private actors know that intermediaries and apps can be a treasure trove of information good data practices can help you avoid being on the wrong side of history and legal hassles to bootafter all if you dont have it you cant produce it 1 allow pseudonymous access give your users the freedom to access your service pseudonymously that is so that even you do not know their identities as weve previously written realname policies and their ilk are especially harmful to vulnerable populations including prodemocracy activists the lgbt communityand people seeking or providing abortion access recognize that authentication or verification schemes that require users to submit identification may also put them at risk 2 stop behavioral tracking dont do it if you must make sure users affirmatively opt in first if thats not possible ensure users know about it and know they can opt out this includes letting users modify data thats been collected about them so far as well as giving them the option to not have your service collect this information about them at all when users opt out delete their data and stop collecting it moving forward offering an optout of targeting but not out of tracking is unacceptable 3 check your retention policy do you really need to keep all of that data youve been collecting now is the time to clean up the logs if you need them to check for abuse or for debugging think carefully about which precise pieces of data you really need and then delete them regularlysay every week for the most sensitive data ip addresses are especially risky to keep avoid logging them or if you must log them for antiabuse or statistics do so in separate files that you can aggregate and delete frequently reject userhostile measures like browser fingerprinting 4 encrypt data in transit seriously encrypt data in transit why are you not already encrypting data in transit does the isp and the entire internet need to know about the information your users are reading the things theyre buying and the places theyre going 5 enable endtoend encryption by default if your service includes messages enable endtoend encryption by default are you offering a highvalue servicelike aipowered recommendations or searchthat doesnt work on encrypted data its time to reevaluate that tradeoff 6 dont allow your app to become a location mine there is an entire industry devoted to collecting and selling location dataand its got a welldocumented history of privacy violations some location data brokers collect that data by getting ordinary app developers to install tracking software into their apps dont do that 7 dont share the data you collect more than necessary and only with trustedvetted partners this one is beyond obvious dont share the data you collect except as necessary to provide the service you are offering even then make sure you vet those third parties own data practices of course this requires actually knowing where your data is going finally avoid thirdparty connections 8 where possible make it interoperable there may be a third party that can do a better job protecting your privacyconscious users than you can alone if so allow them to interoperate with you so they can offer that service push back against improper demandsand be transparent about them for example law enforcement may ask a search engine to provide information about all users who searched for a particular term such as abortion law enforcement may also seek unconstitutional geofence warrants demanding data on every device in a given geographic area law enforcement might use that information to draw a line around an abortion clinic in a neighboring state get a list of every phone thats been there and use that information to track people as they drive back home across state lines private parties meanwhile may leverage the power of the courts to issue subpoenas to try to unmask people who provide information online anonymously 1 stand up for your users challenge unlawful subpoenas for user information in court if a warrant or subpoena is improper push back for example federal courts have ruled that geofence warrants are unconstitutional and there are strong protections in the us for anonymous speech does the court have jurisdiction to require compliance some companies have been willing to stand up for their users join them if your company cant afford legal counsel eff may be able to help 2 at minimum provide notice to affected users your user should never learn that you disclosed their information after its too late for them to do anything about it if you get a data request and there is no legal restriction forbidding you from doing so notify the subject of the request as soon as possible 3 implement strong transparency practices issue transparency reports on a regular basis including statebystate breakdown of data requests and information related to reproductive rights bansrestrictions facebooks transparency report for example is only searchable by country not by state and while the report mentions removing information based on reports from state attorneys general it did not name the states or the reasons for the requests endorse the santa clara principles on transparency and accountability and implement them if you market surveillance technology to governments know your customer this should also be obvious review and revise your community standards policy to discourage abuse social media platforms regularly engage in content moderationthe depublication downranking and sometimes outright censorship of information andor user accounts from social media and other digital platforms usually based on an alleged violation of a platforms community standards policy such moderation however wellintentioned is often deeply flawed confusing and inconsistent particularly when it comes to material related to sexuality and sexual health take for example the attempt by companies to eradicate homophobic and transphobic speech while that sounds like a worthy goal these policies have resulted in lgbtq users being censored for engaging in counterspeech or for using reclaimed terms like dyke facebook bans ads it deems overly suggestive or sexually provocative a practice that has had a chilling effect on womens health startups bra companies a book whose title contains the word uterus and even the national campaign to prevent teen and unwanted pregnancy in addition government and private actors can weaponize community standards policies flagging speech they dont like as violating community standards too often the speaker wont fight back either because they dont know how or because they are intimidated platforms should take another look at their speech policies and consider carefully how they might be abused for example almost every major internet platformfacebook google owner of blogger and youtube twitter and reddit has some prohibition on illegal material but their policies do not explain much further furthermore most have some policy related to local lawsbut they mean laws by country not by state this language leaves a large hole for individuals and governments to claim a user has violated the policy and get lifesaving information removed furthermore as noted facebook has a terrible track record with its policy related to sex and sexual health the company should review how its policy of labeling images associated with birthgiving and afterbirth giving moments including both natural vaginal delivery and caesarean section might lead to confusion if your product or service might be used to target people seeking offering or facilitating abortion access now is the time to minimize the harm that can be done many groups share information through google docsposting links either within a network or even publicly in a postroe world that might include information about activities that are illegal in some states however while google permits users to share educational information about illegal activities it prohibits use of the service to engage in such activities or promote them blogger uses similar language and adds that we will take appropriate action if we are notified of unlawful activities which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities this language may discourage many from using the service to share information that again might be legal in some states and illegal in others in general many sites have language outlawing material that may lead to serious physical or emotional harm depending on how harm is construed and by whom this language too could be an excuse to excise important tools and information worse companies have set some unfortunate recent precedent for example facebooks transparency report mentions in response to covidrelated concerns that it blocked access to 27 items in response to reports from state attorneys general and the us attorney general all 27 were ultimately reinstated as they did not actually violate facebooks community standards or other applicable policies this shows a willingness on facebooks part to act first and ask questions later when contacted by state authorities even if eventually reinstated the harm to people looking for information in a critical timesensitive situation could be incalculable most of these ideas arent new weve been calling for companies to take these steps for years with a new threat model on the horizon its past time for them to act our digital rights depend on it",

is crucial the guardian victory court orders ca prisons to release race of parole candidates adversarial interoperability and data fiduciaries adversarial interoperability eff information fiduciaries must protect your data privacy eff transcript james one of the fun things about being a computer scientist as opposed to lets say a roboticist someone who actually builds physical things im never going to get my eye poked out because my algorithm went wrong like im never going to lose an arm or just be ruined physically because my algorithm didnt work at least on paper right and so i think computer science does tend to draw people who like some of these very stark sort of contrasts like either my algorithm worked or it didnt but i think that whats ended up happening is that in the infancy of the field you could kind of sort of take that approach and nothing too bad would happen but now when you think about everything we do in a day theres a computer involved in almost all of that and so as a result you can no longer afford to say im not going to think about the bigger implications of this thing because im just a hobbyist im just working on some little toy thats not going to be used by thousands or millions of people cindy thats james mickens hes a professor of computer science at harvard school of engineering and applied sciences and a director at the berkman klein center for internet and society hes also a lifelong hacker danny james is going to tell us about some of the problems in educating ethical computer scientists and were going to talk about how fixing those problems might help us fix the internet cindy im cindy cohn effs executive director danny and im danny obrien special advisor to eff welcome to how to fix the internet a podcast of the electronic frontier foundation cindy james thank you so much for joining us its really exciting to talk to you about how computer scientists and other technically minded people will help us move toward a better future and what that future looks like when we get there james well hello thank you for that great introduction and thank you for inviting me to have a chat cindy so lets wallow in the bad for a minute before get to the good whats broken in our internet society now or at least the specific pieces that are most concerning to you james well there are just so many things i mean i could just give you a wood cut like from the medieval period people are on fire theyre weird people with bird masks running around its a scene but if i had to just pick a couple things here are a couple things that i think are bad i think that at a high level one of the big challenges with technology right now is the careless application of various techniques or various pieces of software in a way that doesnt really think about what the collateral damage might be and in a way that doesnt really think about should we be deploying this software in the first place at this point sort of a classic example is machine learning right so machine learning seems pretty neat but when you look at machine learning being applied to things like determining which job applications get forwarded up to the next level determining who gets mortgages and who does not determining who gets sentenced to parole versus a harsher sentence for example what you end up seeing is that you have these really nontrivial applications of technology that have these real impacts in the actual world its not some abstract exercise where were trying to simulate the thought process of an agent in a video game or something like this danny is there something special about computer scientists that makes them like this is it hubris is it just a feeling like theyve got the answer to all of the worlds problems james the way that were sort of trained as computer scientists is to say heres a crisp description of what a problem is and then here are a concrete set of steps which can fix that problem and going through that series of steps of identifying the problem coming up with an algorithm to solve it and then testing it at first glance that seems very clean and in fact there are a couple simple problems we could think of that are very clean to solve so for example i give you a bunch of numbers how do you sort them it seems like a pretty objective thing to do we all have a very clear understanding of what numbers are and what order means but now if i ask you to do something like find the best applicant for a particular job even if you were to ask different humans what the answer to that question is they would probably give you a bunch of different answers and so this idea that somehow because computers manipulate binary data zeros and ones that somehow were always going to have clean answers for things or somehow always be able to take these intractable social problems and represent them in this very clean way in the digital space its just absolutely false and i think machine learning is a particular example of how this goes astray because you end up seeing that you get this data this data has biases in it you train an algorithm that replicates the biases in the training data and that just perpetuates the social problem that we see sort of in the pre digital world cindy when we were first looking at predictive policing for instance which is a set of technologies that try to allegedly predict where crime is going to happen the short answer to this is it actually just predicts what the police are going to do if you define the problem as well police know where crime is then youve missed a whole lot of crime that police never see and dont focus on and dont prioritize so that was an early example i think of that kind of problem james people who live in lets say underprivileged communities or over policed communities if you asked them what would happen if you were to apply one of these predictive policing algorithms i bet a lot of them could intuitively tell you from their personal experience well the police go where they think the police need to go and of course that sets up a feedback circle and just to be clear im not trying to take out some sort of maximalist antipolice position here im just saying there are experiences in the world that are important to bring to bear when you design technical artifacts because these technical artifacts have to relate to society so i think its really important when youre getting a technical education that you also learn about things involving history or sociology or economics things like that cindy i want to switch just a little bit because were trying to fix the internet here and i want to hear whats your vision of what it looks like if we get this righti want to live in that world what does that world look like from where you sit james well a key aspect of that world is that i have been nominated as the philosopher king cindy cool james and thats the first thing and really everything sort of follows danny well get right on that james good to see everyone agrees with it cindy yeah james yeah thank you thank you so i think weve sort of hinted at one of the things that needs to change in my opinion which is the way that technical education is carried out a lot of engineers go through their formal engineering training and theyre taught things like calculus and linear algebra they learn about various programming languages they learn how to design algorithms that run quickly these are all obviously very important things but they oftentimes dont receive in that formal education an understanding of how the artifacts that they build will interact with larger society and oftentimes they dont receive enough education in what are sort of the historical and social and economic trends independent of technology that have existed for hundreds or thousands of years that you should really think about if you want to create technology that helps the common good cindy and the other thing i hear in this is community involvement right that the people who are going to be impacted by the artifact you build need to be some of the people you listen to and that you check into that you go to the neighborhoods where this might be applied or you talk to the people who are trying to figure out how to get a mortgage and you begin to understand what the world looks like in shoes that are not yours are there any places in machine learning where you think that people are starting to get it right or is it still just a wasteland of bad ideas danny allegedly james it is yeah the wasteland word is i still think generally applicable but people are starting to awaken people are starting to look at notions of can we rigorously define transparency in terms of explaining what these algorithms do can we sort of rigorously think about bias and how we might try to address that algorithmically in collaboration with people the field is starting to get better i think there is still a lot of pressure to innovate theres still pressure to publish a lot of papers get your cool new ml technology out there how else am i going to get venture capital things like this so i think theres still a lot of pressure towards not being thoughtful but i do see that changing danny so one of the things that weve seen in other podcast interviews is that actually we are going to have to go and redo some of the fundamentals because were building on weak foundations that we didnt think about computer security when we first started writing operating systems for general use and so forth do you think thats part of this as well not only do we have to change what were going to do in the future but we actually have to go and redo some stuff that engineers made in the past james i think it speaks to these larger issues of tech debt which is a term that you may have heard before this idea that weve already built a bunch of stuff and so for us to go back and then fix it for some definition of fix so would you prefer us to just tackle that problem and not innovate further or would you prefer what should we do i think youre right about that that is an important thing if you look at for example how a lot of the internet protocols work or like how a lot of banking protocols work or things like this systems for doing airline reservations in some cases this code is cobol code it came from the stone age at least in computer science terms and the code is very creaky it has security problems its not fast in many cases but would society tolerate no flights for a year lets say as we go back and we modernize that stuff the answer is no obviously so then as a result we kind of creak forward if you think about the basic core internet infrastructure when it was designed roughly speaking it was like a small neighborhood most people on the internet knew everybody why would sally ever try to attack my computer i know her our kids go to the same school that would just be outrageous but now we live in a world where the internets pervasive thats good but now everyone doesnt know everyone and now there are bad actors out there and so we can try to add security incrementally thats what https does the s stands for security right so we can try to layer security at top these sort of creaky ships but its hard i think a lot of our software and hardware artifacts are like that its really getting back i think to cindys question too about what would i want to see improved about the future i always tell this to my students and i wish more people would think about this its easier to fix problems early rather than later that seems like a very obvious thing that yoda would say but its actually quite profound because once you get things out in the world and once they get a lot of adoption for you to change any little thing about it is going to be this huge exercise and so its really helpful to be thoughtful at the beginning in the design process cindy youve thought a little bit of about how we could get more thoughtfulness into the design process and id love for you to talk about some of those ideas james sure one thing that im really proud of working on is this embedded ethics program that we have at harvard and thats starting to be adopted by other institutions and it gets back to this idea of what does it mean to train an engineer and so what were trying to do in this program is ensure that every class that a computer scientist takes therell be at least one lecture that talks about ethical considerations concerns involving people and society and the universe that are specific to that class now i think the specific to that class part is very important right because i think another thing that engineers sometimes get confused about is they might say oh well these ethical concerns are only important for machine learning i get it machine learning interacts of people but its not important for people who build data centers why should i care about those things but lets interrogate that for a second where do you build data center well data centers require a lot of power so where is that electricity going to come from how is that electricity going to be generated what is the impact on the surrounding community things like this theres also sort of like these interesting geopolitical concerns there so how many data centers should we have in north america versus africa what does the decision that we come to say about how we value different users in different parts of the world as computer scientists we have to accept this idea we dont know everything close to everything but not everything right and so one of the important aspects of this embedded ethics program is that we bring in philosophers and collaborate with them and help use their knowledge to ground our discussions of these philosophical challenges in computer science cindy do you have any success stories yet or is it just too early james well some of the success stories involve students saying i was thinking about going to company x but now ive actually decided not to go there because ive actually thought about what these companies are doing im not here to name or shame but suffice it to say that i think thats a really big metric for success and were actually trying to look at assessment instruments talk to people from sociology or whatnot who know how to assess effectiveness and then tweak pedagogical programs to make sure that were actually having the impact that we want cindy well i hope that means that were going to have a whole bunch of these students beat a path to eefs door and want to come and do tech for good with us because weve been doing it longer than anyone danny how to fix the internet is supported by the alfred p sloan foundations program in public understanding of science enriching peoples lives through a keener appreciation of our increasingly technological world and portraying the complex humanity of scientists engineers and mathematicians cindy were landing some societal problems on the shoulders of individual computer scientists and expecting them to kind of incorporate a lot of things that really are kind of built into our society like the venture capital interest in creating new products as quickly as possible the profit motive or these other things and im just wondering how poor little ethics can do standing up against some of these other forces james i think sort of the high level sort of prompts is late stage capitalism what do we do about it cindy fair enough james you are right there and alas i dont have immediate solutions to that problem cindy but youre supposed to be the philosopher king my friend james fair enough so youre right i think that theres not like a magic trick we can do where we can say oh well well just teach computer scientists and ethics and then all of a sudden the incentives for vcs will be changed because the incentives for vcs are make a lot of money frequently make a lot money over the short term they are not incentivized by the larger economy to act differently but i think that the fact that better trained engineers cant solve all problems shouldnt prevent us from trying to help them to solve some problems i think that theres a lot of good that those types of engineers can do and try to start changing some of these alignments and theres a responsibility that should come with making products that affect potentially millions of people so i sometimes hear this from students though youre exactly right sometimes theyll say its not my job to change sort of the larger macroeconomic incentive structures that make various things happen but then i say well but what are some of the biggest drivers of those macroeconomic incentive structures its tech companies when you look at sort of stock market valuations and economic influence its these companies that you the student will be going to that are helping to shape these narratives and also too its you the students youll go out youll vote youll think about ballot referendums things like that so there are things that we all have the responsibility to think about and to do individually even though any one of us cant just sort of snap our fingers and make the change be immediate we have to do that because otherwise society falls apart danny so some of this discussion assumes that we have like universal ethics that we all agree on but i think theres always i mean part of the challenge in society is that we have room to disagree is there a risk that if we inject this sort of precautionary principle into what we are doing were actually missing out on some of the benefits of this rapid change if we hold back and go well maybe we shouldnt do this were excluding the chance that these things will actually make society much much better for everyone james as an engineer trying to design a system to be value neutral that in and of itself is an ethical decision youve made the decision to say like not considering social or economic factors x y and z is the right thing to do that is an ethical decision and so i think a lot of engineers though they fall into that fallacy they say well im just going to focus on the code im just going to focus on the thing im going to build and itll be the users of that software that have to determine how to use it ethically or not but that argument is that just doesnt work the mere fact that people may disagree over values does not absolve us of the responsibility from thinking about those values nonetheless cindy to me especially in a situation in which youre building something thats going to impact people who arent involved in the building of it right i mean you can build your own machine learning to tell you what you want about your life and i dont have much to say about that but a lot of these systems are making decisions for people who have no input whatsoever into how these things are being built no transparency into how theyre working and no ability to really interrogate the conclusions that are made and to me thats where it gets the riskiest james i often turn to existential philosophy in cases like this for the listeners who arent familiar with philosophy or think that its all very obtuse thats true about some of it but if you read the existentialists its quite beautiful a lot of the prose its just really fun to read and it has these really impactful observations and one of my favorite passages is from this guy kierkegaard and kierkegaards talking about sort of like this burden of choice that we have and he has this really beautiful metaphor where he says we are each the captain of our own ship and even if we choose not to put our hand on the rudder to point the ship in some direction the wind will nevertheless push us towards some shore and so in deciding where you want to go you make a decision if you decide not to make an active decision about where to sail your boat youre basically deciding i will let the wind tell me where to go the metaphor is telling us that your boats still going to go in some direction even if you dont actively become the captain of it and i think about that a lot because a lot of engineers want to abdicate themselves with the responsibility for being the captain of their own boat and they say im just going to focus on the boat and thats it but in this metaphor sort of society and built in biases and things like that those are the winds those are the currents and theyre going to push your product theyre going to push your software towards some shore and thats going to happen regardless of whether you think thats going to happen or not so we really have this responsibility to choose and decide danny i hate to follow kierkegaard with stan lee but is that with great power comes great responsibility and i wonder if part of these ethical discussions is whether thats not the problem that you are asking engineers and the creators of this technology to make ethical decisions sort of that will affect the rest of society and the problem is that actually it should be the rest of society that makes those decisions and not the engineers maybe the harder work is to spread that power more equally and give everyone a little element of being an engineer like that they can change the technology in front of them james i think that what youre talking about sort of at a broad level is governance how do we do governance of online systems and its a mess right now its a combination of internal company policies which are not made public external that is to say publicly visible policies regulation the behavior of individual users on the platform and its a big mess because i think that right now a lot of times what happens is a disaster happens and then all of a sudden theres some movement by both the companies and maybe regulators to change something thing and then thatll be it for a bit and then things kind of creak along then another disaster happens so itd be nice to think about in a more systemic way how we should govern these platforms cindy as a free speech fourth amendment lawyer having governments have more say over the things that we say in our privacy and those kinds of things well that hasnt always worked out all that well for individual rights either right but we have these gigantic companies they have a lot of power and its reasonable to think well what else has a lot of power that might be able to be a check on them well theres government and thats all true but the devil really is in the details and we worry as much about bad corporate behavior as we do bad governmental behavior and you have to think about both cindy so lets say youre the philosopher king or in your great new world what does it look like for me as a user in this future world james i think one important aspect is more transparency about how your data is used who it gets shared with what is the value that companies are getting from it and were moving a little bit in that direction slowly but surely laws like gdpr ccpa theyre trying to slowly nudge us in this direction its a very hard problem though as we all know i mean engineers may not fully understand what their systems do so then how are they going to explain that in a transparent way to users but in sort of this utopia thats an important aspect of online services theres more transparency in how things work i think theres also more consent in how things work so these things go hand in hand so users would have more of an ability to opt into or opt out of various manipulations or sharings of their data once again were starting to go a little bit closer towards that i think we can do much much more i think that in terms of content moderation i think and this is going to be tricky its going to be hard this speaks to sort of cindys observations about well we cant fully trust government or the companies but in my opinion i mean im the philosopher king in this experiment so in my opinion what i want to have is i want to have a floor that defines sort of minimal standards for protections against hate speech harassment things like that of course the devils and the details but i think thats actually something that we dont really have right now theres also this important aspect of having educated like citizens right so having more technical education and technical literacy for laypeople so that they can better understand the consequences of their action cindy that we know what choices were making were in charge of these choices and have actual choices i think are all tremendously important eff has worked a lot around adversarial interoperability and other things which are really about being able to leave a place that isnt serving you and to me thats got to be a piece of the choice a choice that doesnt really let you leave is not actually a choice james as you may know there have been some recent proposals that want to solve this portability issue essentially by saying lets have users store all their data on user owned machines and then the companies have to come to us for permission to use that data theres a sort of push and pull there in terms of on the one hand wanting to give people literal power over their data such that its actually their machines that are storing it versus saying well if i look at like the computers that are administered by my relatives for example who are not computer scientists these computers are offline all the time theyve got like terrible ridiculous programs on them theyre not reliable now in contrast you look at a data center thats administered by paid professionals whose job it is to keep those machines online so theres an advantage to using that model do we want to still keep our data in centralized places but then make sure theres plumbing to move stuff between those centralized places or do we want to in the extreme go towards this peer to peer decentralized model and then lose some of the performance benefits we get from the data center model cindy thats a good articulation of some of the tradeoffs here and of course the other way to go is kind of on the lawyer side of things is a duty of care that people who hold your data have a fiduciary or something similar kind of duty to you in the same way that your accountant or lawyer might have so they have your data but they dont have the freedom to do with it what they want in fact theyre very limited in what they can do with it i feel very optimistic in a certain way that there are mechanisms on the technical side and the nontechnical side to try to get us to this kind of control again none of them are without tradeoffs but they exist all across the board james yes and i think an interesting area of research its an area that im a bit interested in myself is what are specific technical things that software developers can do to provide obvious compliance with legal regulations because these laws theyre just like any human creation they can be vague or ambiguous in some cases they can be difficult to implement and i think that part of this gets down to having these different communities talk to each other one reason its difficult for computer scientists to write code that complies with legal requirements is that we dont understand some of these legal requirements the lawyers need to learn a little bit more about code and the computer scientists need to learn a little bit more about the law cindy its also the case of course that sometimes laws get written without a clear idea of how one might reduce it to ones and zeros and so that may be a bug if youre a computer scientist it might be a feature if youre a lawyer right because then we let judges sort out in the context of individual situations what things really mean james so one of the gifts of the philosopher king to lure people under these semantic morasses cindy thank you so much king james no problem of course its been great sitting here chatting with you let me return back to my kingdom danny james mickens thank you very much james thank you cindy well james teaches computer science at harvard so its right that his focus is on education and personal ethics and transparency this is the work of the computer scientists and i appreciate that hes working and thinking hard about how we build more ethical builders and also that hes recognizing that we need to kind of move beyond the silos that computer science often finds itself in and reach out to people with other kinds of expertise especially philosophy but we also heard from him about the importance of the role of the impacted community which is something weve heard over and over again in this podcast and the need to make sure that the people who are impacted by technology understand how it works and have a voice danny it wasnt just sort of this literally academic kind of discussion he had some practical points too i mean for instance that if we do need to improve things and fix things we found some ways of doing incremental security improvements like https but some really have to overcome a lot of tech debt and i dont think were going to be in a situation where we can ask people not to book airplane tickets while we fix the fundamentals which again points out to what hes saying which is that we need to get this stuff right earlier rather than later in this process cindy and i loved hearing about this embedded ethics program that hes working on at harvard and at other places and the idea that we need to build ethics into every class and every situation not just something we tack on separately at the end i think is a very good start and of course if it leads to a line of students who want to do ethical tech beating their way to effs doors that would be an extra bonus for us danny it does make everything a little bit more complicated to think of ethics and the wider impact i mean i did take on board his comparison of the ease of building a centralized internet which might have deleterious effects on society with the obvious solution which is to decentralize things but you have to make that just as easy to use for the end user and then somebody whos hacking away trying to build a decentralized web thats something i definitely took personally and will take on board cindy theres tradeoffs everywhere you go and i think in that way james is just a true educator right hes requiring us all to look at the complexities in all directions so that we can really bring all those complexities into thinking about the solutions we embrace after this conversation i kind of want to live in the world where james is our philosopher king danny thanks to you james mickens our supreme leader and thanks you for listening today please

    "eff and other civil society organizations issue report on danger to digital rights in ola bini trial in preparation for what may be the final days of the trial of ola bini an open source and free software developer arrested shortly after julian assanges ejection from ecuadors london embassy civil society organizations observing the case have issued a report citing due process violations technical weaknesses political pressures and risks that this criminal prosecution entails for the protection of digital rights bini was initially detained three years ago and previous stages of his prosecution had significant delays that were criticized by the office of the interamerican commission on human rights iachr special rapporteur for freedom of expression an online press conference is scheduled for may 11th with eff and other organizations set to speak on the violations in binis prosecution and the danger this case represents the trial hearing is set for may 1620 and will most likely conclude next week if convicted binis defense can still appeal the decision whats happened so far the first part of the trial against ola bini took place in january in this first stage of testimony and expert evidence the court repeatedly called attention to various irregularities and violations to due process by the prosecutor in charge human rights groups observing the hearing emphasized the flimsy evidence provided against bini and serious flaws in how the seizure of his devices took place binis defense stressed that the raid happened without him present and that seized encrypted devices were examined without following procedural rules and safeguards these are not the only problems with the case over two years ago eff visited ecuador on a factfinding mission after binis initial arrest and detention what we found was a case deeply intertwined with the political effects of its outcome fraught with due process violations effs conclusions from our ecuador mission were that political actors including the prosecution have recklessly tied their reputations to a case with controversial or no real evidence ola bini is known globally as someone who builds secure tools and contributes to free software projects binis team at thoughtworks contributed to certbot the effmanaged tool that has provided strong encryption for millions of websites around the world and most recently bini cofounded a nonprofit organization devoted to creating userfriendly security tools what bini is not known for however is conducting the kind of security research that could be mistaken for an assault on the integrity of computer systems the crime for which he was initially investigated or unauthorized access to a computer system the crime for which he is being accused now after prosecutors changed the charges in 2019 binis lawyers counted 65 violations of due process and journalists told us at the time that no one was able to provide them with concrete descriptions of what he had done binis initial imprisonment was ended after a decision considered his detention illegal but the investigation continued the judge was later separated from the case in a ruling that admitted the wrongdoing of successive pretrial suspensions and the violation of due process though a judge decided in last years pretrial hearing to proceed with the criminal prosecution against bini observers indicated a lack of solid motivation in the judges decision a new persecution a socalled piece of evidence against bini was a photo of a screenshot supposedly taken by bini himself and sent to a colleague showing the telnet login screen of a router the image is consistent with someone who connects to an open telnet service receives a warning not to log on without authorization and does not proceedrespecting the warning as for the portion of a message exchange attributed to bini and a colleague leaked with the photo it shows their concern with the router being insecurely open to telnet access on the wider internet with no firewall between the trial hearing in january and its resumption in may ecuadors prosecutors office revived an investigation against fabián hurtado the technical expert called by ola binis defense to refute the image of the telnet session and who is expected to testify at the trial hearing on january 10 2022 the prosecutors office filed charges for procedural fraud against hurtado there was a conspicuous gap between this charge and the last investigative proceeding by prosecutors in the case against hurtado when police raided his home almost 20 months before claiming that he had incorporated misleading information in his résumé this raid was violent and irregular and considered by amnesty international as an attempt to intimidate ola binis defense one of the pieces of evidence against hurtado is the document by which binis lawyer dr carlos soria included hurtados technical report in binis case file hurtados indictment hearing was held on february 9 2022 the judge opened a 90day period of investigation which is about to end as part of this investigation the prosecutors office and the police raided the offices of ola binis nonprofit organization in a new episode of due process violations according to media reports civil society report and recommendations todays report by organizations gathered in the observation mission of binis case is critical for all participating and to others concerned about digital rights around the world there is still time for the court to recognize and correct the irregularities and technical weaknesses in the case it points out key points that should be taken into consideration by the judicial authorities in charge of examining the case in particular the report notes the accusations have failed to demonstrate a consistent case against ola bini irregularities in court procedures and police action have affected both the speed of the procedure and due process of law in general in addition accusations against bini show little technical knowledge and could lead to the criminalization of people carrying out legitimate activities protected by international human rights standards this case may lead to the further persecution of the socalled infosec community in latin america which is made up primarily of security activists who find vulnerabilities in computer systems carrying out work that has a positive impact on society in general the attempt to criminalize ola bini already shows a hostile scenario for these activists and consequently for the safeguard of our rights in the digital environment moreover these activists must be guaranteed the right to use the tools necessary for their workfor example the importance of online anonymity must be respected as a premise for the exercise of several human rights such as privacy and freedom of expression this right is protected by international human rights standards which recognize the use of encryption including tools such as tor as fundamental for the exercise of these rights these researchers and activists protect the computer systems on which we all depend and protect the people who have incorporated electronic devices into their daily lives such as human rights defenders journalists and activists among many other key actors for democratic vitality ola bini and others who work in the field must be protectednot persecuted",

    "safegraphs disingenuous claims about location data mask a dangerous industry on tuesday motherboard reported that data broker safegraph was selling location information related to visits to clinics that provide abortions including planned parenthood facilities this included where people came from and where they went afterwards in response safegraph agreed to stop selling data about planned parenthood visitors but it also defended its behavior claiming safegraph has always committed to the highest level of privacy practices ensuring individual privacy is never compromised the company it continued only sell[s] data about physical places not individuals this framing is misleading first safegraph for years did sell data about individualsand then remained closely tied to a business that still did so second the aggregated location data that safegraph now sells is based on the same sensitive individual location traces that are collected and sold without meaningful consent safegraphs history of privacy violations last year eff reported public records showing that safegraph had sold 2 years of disaggregated devicespecific location data about millions of people to the illinois government starting in january 2019 older materials about safegraph indicate that it used to offer a product called movement panel a 2017 blog post from two people at safegraph describes movement panel as a database of ultraaccurate gpslocation data that comes from anonymized mobile devices it also describes how safegraph used the bidstreamthat is data siphoned from the millions of apps that solicit ads on the open market through realtime bidding use of bidstream data is considered ethically dubious even within marketing circles in part because it is nearly impossible to get knowing consent when data is shared and sold among hundreds of unseen parties its entirely possible that safegraph itself no longer sells this kind of data but thats not the whole story in 2019 safegraph spun off a company called veraset and the two companies remained tight in 2020 quartz reported that [safegraph] says it gets mobility data from providers like its spinoff veraset which own the relationships with the apps that gather its data veraset doesnt share the names of the apps with safegraph founder auren hoffman and other safegraph employees have also used safegraph forums to direct potential customers to veraset for specific data needs veraset sells raw disaggregated perdevice location data last year eff received records showing how veraset gave a free trial of such data to officials in washington dc as well as other unnamed agencies veraset offers a product called movement as the company explains it our core population human movement dataset delivers the most granular and frequent gps signals available in a thirdparty dataset unlike other data providers who rely on one sdk we source from thousands of apps and sdks to avoid a biased sample sdk means a software development kit embedded in a mobile app which can be used to gather location data in sum veraset is in the business of selling precise pinglevel location data from the smart phones of millions of people safegraph itself was in this business until it spun those services off to veraset and after this spinoff safegraph continued to acquire data from veraset and steer business there but a corporate restructuring does not make anyone safer highly invasive data about millions of people is still up for sale putting vulnerable people at serious risk the places not people fallacy with that context in mind lets consider safegraphs claim that it only sells data about physical places not individuals however the company frames it the data is about people safegraphs data comes from mobile devices carried by human beings and represents large portions of their daily movements habits and routines marketers transportation departments law enforcement and others are only interested in location data because it reveals things about the people who visit those locations when location data is disaggregated and devicespecific as in safegraphs contract with illinois it is effectively impossible to deidentify information about where a person has been itself is usually enough to reidentify them for example someone who travels frequently between a given office building and a singlefamily home is probably unique in those habits and therefore identifiable from other readily identifiable sources one widely cited study from 2013 even found that researchers could uniquely characterize 50 of people using only two randomly chosen time and location data points a national security contractor that peddles the same kind of data relies on its specificity as one spokesperson said during a live demonstration if im a foreign intel officer i dont have access to things like the agency or the fort i can find where those people live i can find where they travel i can see when they leave the country aggregation of location data can sometimes preserve individual privacy depending on appropriate aggregation parameters and choices factors include the number of people and phone pings in the data set and the granularity of the location described such as square miles versus square feet but no privacypreserving aggregation protocols can justify the initial collection of location data from people without their voluntary optin consent especially when that location data is then exploited for profit sensitive data should only be collected and used with specific informed consent and we must reserve the right to withdraw that consent at any time data brokers like safegraph do not meet these standards what can we do users who are concerned about tracking by data brokers can take simple steps to reduce their impact read our new guide to digital safety and privacy tips for people involved in abortion access as well as our surveillance selfdefense playlist for

disable the advertising id on your phone which is the primary key that brokers use to link data to individuals heres how on android and ios disable location permissions for apps you dont trust and generally audit the permissions that thirdparty apps are granted use a browser that respects your privacy like safari or firefox and install a tracker blocker like privacy badger for extra protection if you live in california you can file a right to know request with safegraph and veraset to see what information they have about you you can also exercise your right to opt out of sale and request that the companies delete your personal information unfortunately safegraph and veraset are just two of the hundreds of data brokers that profit from personal information you can see a list of brokers and find out how to exercise your rights at the california attorney generals registry nevada residents can also request that the brokers refrain from selling your data in the future if you are a

    "the movement to ban government use of face recognition in the hands of police and other government agencies face recognition technology presents an inherent threat to our privacy free expression information security and social justice our faces are unique identifiers that cant be left at home or replaced like a stolen id or compromised password the technology facilitates covert mass surveillance of the places we frequent people we associate with and purportedly our emotional state fortunately communities across the country are fighting back in the three years since san francisco passed its firstofakind ban on government use of facial recognition at least 16 more municipalities from oakland to boston have followed their lead these local bans are necessary to protect residents from harms that are inseparable from municipal use of this dangerous technology the most effective of the existing bans on government face surveillance have crucial elements in common they broadly define the technology provide effective mechanisms for any community member to take legal enforcement action should the ordinance be violated and limit the use of any information acquired in an inadvertent breach of the prohibition there are however important nuances in how each ordinance accomplishes these goals here we will identify the best features of 17 local bans on government use of face recognition we hope this will help show authors of the next round how best to protect their communities you can press the play button below to see a map showing the 17 communities that have adopted these bans

this embed will serve content from googlecom here is a list of these 17 communities berkeley ca boston ma brookline ma cambridge ma king county wa madison wi minneapolis mn new orleans la northampton ma oakland ca pittsburgh pa portland me portland or san francisco ca santa cruz ca somerville ma springfield ma definition of face recognition particular consideration must be given in any techrelated legislation to define what tools and applications are and are not intended to be covered complicating that challenge is the need to define the relevant technology broadly enough to assure that emerging capabilities are suitably captured while not inadvertently impacting technologies and applications that should not fall within the bills scope here many forms of government use of face recognition technology may present significant threats to essential civil liberties they may also exacerbate bias today the most widely deployed class of face recognition is often called face matching this can be used for face identification that is an attempt to link photographs of unknown people to their real identities for example police might take a faceprint from a new image eg taken by a surveillance camera and compare it against a database of known faceprints eg a government database of id photos it can also be used for face verification for example to determine whether a person may have access to a location or device other forms of face matching include face clustering or automatically assembling together all the images of one person and face tracking or automatically following a persons movements through physical space all of these threaten digital rights another application of face recognition is face analysis also known as face inference which proponents claim can identify demographic traits emotional state and more based on facial features this invites additional bias and suggests a return to the age of phrenology bans on government use of face recognition must be drawn broadly enough to address all of these threats fortunately many of the existing bans follow bostons example in defining face surveillance and face surveillance systems as > face surveillance shall mean an automated or semiautomated process that assists in identifying or verifying an individual or in capturing information about an individual based on the physical characteristics of an individuals face face surveillance system shall mean any computer software or application that performs face surveillance critically these definitions are not limited just to face identification and face verification but extend also to other technologies that use face characteristics to capture information about people oakland california offers another strong example > face recognition technology means an automated or semiautomated process that a assists in identifying or verifying an individual based on an individuals face or b identifies or logs characteristics of an individuals face head or body to infer emotion associations expressions or the location of an individual notably it extends beyond face characteristics to also cover head and body characteristics it thus captures many of the current uses and futureproofs for some of the most concerning types of biometric data importantly each definition effectively captures the intended technology and applications while not inadvertently capturing lessconcerning practices such as ordinary film video and still photography dont use it dont outsource it while it is critical that cities ban their own agencies from acquiring and using face recognition technology this alone is not enough to protect residents from harm it is also necessary for cities to ban their agencies from acquiring or using information derived from face recognition technology otherwise city employees banned from using the technology could just ask others to use the technology for them while police departments in large cities like new york and detroit may have inhouse face recognition systems and teams of operators many more local police agencies around the country turn to state agencies fusion centers and the fbi for assistance with their face recognition inquiries thus legislation that addresses the technology while not addressing the information derived from the technology may have little impact lawmakers in several cities including berkeley have taken the important additional step of making it unlawful to access or use information obtained from face recognition technology regardless of the source of that information > it shall be a violation of this ordinance for the city manager or any person acting on the city managers behalf to obtain retain request access or use i any face recognition technology or ii any information obtained from face recognition technology berkeleys ordinance further elaborates that even when city employees inadvertently gain access to information derived from face recognition technology the data generally must be promptly destroyed and cannot be used also any inadvertent receipt or use of this information must be logged and included in the citys annual technology report including what measures were taken to prevent further transmission or use this vital transparency measure assures residents and legislators are made aware of these errors and can better identify any patterns suggesting intentional circumvention of the laws intent exemptions exceptions can swallow any rule authors and supporters of bans on government use of face recognition must tread carefully when carving out allowable uses first some ordinances allow face detection technologies that identify and blur faces in government records to prepare them for disclosure under freedom of information acts foias this can help ensure for example transparent public access to governmentheld videos of police use of force while protecting the privacy of the civilians depicted face detection technology does not require the creation of faceprints that distinguish one person from another so it raises fewer privacy concerns unfortunately there can be racial disparities in accuracy king countys ordinance provides two necessary safeguards for government use of face detection technology it can only be used for the purpose of redacting a recording for release to protect the privacy of a subject depicted in the recording also it can not generate or result in the retention of any facial recognition information second some ordinances allow local government to provide its employees with phones and similar personal devices for use on the job that unlock with the employees faceprint some employees use their devices to collect personal information about members of the public and that information should be securely stored while passwords provide stronger protection some employees might fail to lock their devices at all without the convenience of face locks third some ordinances allow local government to use face locks to control access to restricted government buildings portland maines ordinance has two important safeguards as to people authorized for entry no data can be processed without their optin consent as to other people no data can be processed at all fourth a few ordinances allow police when investigating a specific crime to acquire and use information that another entity obtained through face recognition eff opposes these exemptions which invite gamesmanship at a minimum police prohibited from themselves using this tech must also be prohibited from asking another agency to use this tech on their behalf boston has this rule but unsolicited information is also a problem san francisco police broadly circulated a bulletin to other agencies including the photo of an unknown suspect one of these agencies responded by running face recognition on that photo and then san francisco police used the resulting information new orleans ordinance goes a step farther prohibiting use of information generated by this tech with the knowledge of a city official fortunately 12 of 17 jurisdictions do not have this exemption at all fifth a few jurisdictions exempt compliance with the national child search assistance act this is unnecessary that act simply requires agencies to report information they already have and does not require any acquisition or use of technology or information fortunately 13 of 17 jurisdictions eschew this exemption enforcement it is not enough to ban government use of face recognition it is also necessary to enforce this ban the best way is to empower community members to file their own enforcement lawsuits these are called private rights of action the best ones broadly define who can sue in oakland for example any violation of this article constitutes an injury and any person may institute proceedings it is a mistake to limit enforcement just to a person who can show injury from being subjected to face recognition it can be exceedingly difficult to identify such people despite a brazen violation of the ordinance further government use of face recognition harms the entire community including through the chilling of protest in public spaces private enforcement requires a full arsenal of remedies a judge must have the power to order a city to comply with the ordinance also there should be damages for a person who was subjected to face recognition oakland provides this a prevailing plaintiff should be paid their reasonable attorney fees this ensures access to the courts for everyone and not just wealthy people who can afford to hire a lawyer san francisco properly allows full recovery of all reasonable fees other enforcement tools are also important first evidence collected in violation of the ordinance should be excluded from court proceedings as in minneapolis second employees who blow the whistle on rulebreaking should be protected as in berkeley third employees who break the rules should be subject to workplace discipline as in brookline other bans when legislators and advocates write a ban on government use of face recognition they should consider whether to also ban government use of other kinds of surveillance technologies many are so dangerous and invasive that government should not use them at all for example eff opposes government use of predictive policing we are pleased that four cities have ordinances forbidding municipal use new orleans oakland pittsburgh and santa cruz likewise eff supported oaklands ban on municipal use of voiceprints nationwide ban city and countylevel lawmakers are not alone in understanding that government use of face surveillance technology chills free speech threatens residents privacy and amplifies historical bias federal lawmakers including senators edward markey jeff merkley bernie sanders elizabeth warren and ron wyden alongside us representatives pramila jayapal ayanna pressley and rashida tlaib have stepped forward in introducing the facial recognition and biometric technology moratorium act s2052hr3907 if passed it would ban federal agencies like immigration and customs enforcement the drug enforcement administration the federal bureau of investigation and customs and border protection from using face recognition to surveil us residents and travelers the act would also withhold certain federal funding from local and state governments that use face recognition take action if you dont live in one of the 17 cities that have already adopted a local ban on government use of face recognition theres no place like home to begin making a change in fact there may already be groups in your community setting the wheels in motion our about face campaign helps local organizers educate their representatives and communities and every resident to take that first step in calling for change if you have an electronic frontier alliance group in your area they can also be a great resource in finding likeminded neighbors and activists to amplify your efforts if your city has already protected you and your neighbors and even if it has not yet you can still stand up for friends and loved ones by letting your congressional representatives know its time to ban federal use of face recognition too",
    "digital security and privacy tips for those involved in abortion access legislation deputizing people to find sue and collect damages from anyone who tries to help people seeking abortion care creates serious digital privacy and security risks for those involved in abortion access patients their family members and friends doctors nurses clinic staff reproductive rights activists abortion rights counselors and website operators insurance providers and even drivers who help take patients to clinics may face grave risks to their privacy and safety other legislation that does not depend on deputizing bounty hunters but rather criminalizes abortion presents even more significant risks those targeted by antiabortion laws can if they choose take steps to better protect their privacy and security though there is no onesizefitsall digital security solution some likely risks are clear one set of concerns involves law enforcement and state actors who may have expensive and sophisticated surveillance technology at their disposal as well as warrants and subpoenas because of this using nontechnical approaches in combination with technical ones may be more effective at protecting yourself private actors in states with bounty laws may also try to enlist a courts subpoena power to seek information associated with your isp address for example or other data that might be collected by the services you use but it may still be easier to protect yourself from this private surveillance using technical approaches this guide will cover some of each developing risk awareness and a routine of keeping your data private and secure takes practice whether the concern is over digital surveillance like tracking what websites youve visited or attempts to obtain personal communications using the courts its good to begin by thinking at a high level about ways you can improve your overall security and keep your online activities private then as you come to understand the potential scope of risks you may face you can narrow in on the tools and techniques that are the best fit for your concerns here are some highlevel tips to help you get started we recommend pairing them with some specific guides weve highlighted here to be clear it is virtually impossible to devise a perfect security strategybut good practices can help 1 compartmentalization in essence this is doing your best to keep more sensitive activities separate from your daytoday ones compartmentalizing your digital footprint can include developing the habit of never reusing passwords having separate browsers for different purposes and backing up sensitive data onto external drives recommendations use different browsers for different use cases more private browsers like duckduckgo brave and firefox are better for more sensitive activities keeping separate browsers can protect against accidental data spillover from one aspect of your life into another use a secondary email address andor phone number to register sensitive accounts or give to contacts with whom you dont want to associate too closely google voice is a free secondary phone number protonmail and tutanota are free email services that offer many privacy protections that more common providers like gmail do not such as endtoend encryption when emailing others also on protonmail and tutanota and fewer embedded tracking mechanisms on the service itself use a vpn when you need to dissociate your internet connection from what youre doing online be wary of vpn products that sell themselves as cureall solutions if youre going tofrom a location thats more likely to have increased surveillance or if youre particularly worried about who might know youre there turning off your devices or their location services can help keep your location private 2 community agreements its likely that others in your community share your digital privacy concerns deciding for yourself what information is safer to share with your community then coming together to decide what kind of information cannot be shared outside the group is a great nontechnical way to address many information security problems think of it in three levels what information should you share with nobody what information is ok to share with a smaller more trusted group and what information is fine to share publicly recommendations come up with special phrases to mask sensitive communications push a culture of consent when it comes to sharing data about one another be it pictures personal information and so on asking for permission first is a good way to establish trust and communication with each other agree to communicate with each other on more secure platforms like signal or offline 3 safe browsing there are many ways that data on your browser can undermine your privacy and security or be weaponized against you limiting unwanted tracking and reducing the likelihood that data from different aspects of your life spills into one another is a great way to layer on more protection recommendations install privacypreserving browser extensions on any browsers you use privacy badger ublock origin and duckduckgo are great options use a privacyfocused search engine like duckduckgo carefully look at the privacy settings on each app and account you use turn off location services on phone apps that dont need them raise the bar on privacy settings for most if not all your online accounts disable the ad identifier on mobile devices ad ids are specifically designed to facilitate thirdparty tracking and disabling them makes it harder to profile you instructions for android devices and ios devices are here choose a browser thats more private by design duckduckgo on mobile and firefox with privacy settings turned up on the desktop are both good options 4 security checklists make a todo list of tools techniques and practices to use when you are doing anything that requires a bit more care when it comes to digital privacy and security this is not only good to have so that you dont forget anything but is extremely helpful when you find yourself in a more highstress situation where trying to remember these things is far from the top of your mind recommendations tools vpns for hiding your location and circumventing local internet censorship encrypted messaging apps for avoiding surveillance and anonymized credit cards for keeping

    "the eus copyright directive is still about filters but eus top court limits its use the court of justice of the european union has issued a longawaited judgment on the compatibility of the eu copyright directives filtering requirements with the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the ruling recognizes the tension between copyright filters and the right to freedom of expression but falls short of banning upload filters altogether under article 17 of the eus controversial copyright directive large tech companies must ensure that infringing content is not available on their platforms or they could be held liable for it given that legal risk platforms will inevitably rely on errorprone upload filters that undermine lawful online speech as poland pointed out in the legal challenge that led to the judgment no alternatives to filtering tools but strong user safeguards the court acknowledged that article 17s obligation to review content constitutes a de facto requirement to use automatic recognition and filtering tools and held that such mechanisms would indeed constitute an interference with users freedom of expression rights however as with last years opinion of the court of justices advocate general the judges concluded that the safeguards provided by article 17 were adequate because those safeguards include an obligation to ensure the availability of lawful uploads an automated system that cannot distinguish adequately between unlawful content and lawful content wont pass muster under eu law the court also highlighted the responsibility of rightsholders to provide platforms with undoubtedly relevant and necessary information of an unlawful use of copyrighted material platform providers cannot be forced to generally monitor user content to check the legality of content that also means that they cannot be required to conduct an independent assessment of the content if a platform ends up removing lawful content users can invoke the directives complaint and redress mechanisms to block or not to block the courts focus on interpreting exceptions and limitations to copyright in a way that preserves fundamental rights is laudable and follows the effs own suggestions following the courts criteria platforms can argue that they are only required to use upload filters in obvious cases that in turn could trigger a requirement for several eu member states to go rework their implementations of the eu copyright directive which ignore the fundamental rights perspective the ruling means that national governments must pay much stronger attention to user rights however the court failed to set out parameters to help platforms decide when and when not to block content worse it sidestepped the core issue whether automated tools can ever be reasonably implemented its hard to see how the measures implied by this ruling can actually ensure that speechintrusive measures are strictly targeted in the ruling the court explained the limits of content monitoring by referring to theglawischnigpiesczek v facebook case a speechintrusive case involving the removal of defamatory content but that reference doesnt tell us much the court in glawischnigpiesczek v facebook ignored the state of the art and realworld operations of automated search tools and technologies tools and underestimated how screening efforts by platforms could easily become excessive undermining users fundamental rights",

    "podcast episode teaching ai to its targets too many young people particularly young people of color lack enough familiarity or experience with emerging technologies to recognize how artificial intelligence can impact their lives in either a harmful or an empowering way educator ora tanner saw this and rededicated her career toward promoting tech literacy and changing how we understand data sharing and surveillance as well as teaching how ai can be both a dangerous tool and a powerful one for innovation and activism by now her curricula have touched more than 30000 students many of them in her home state of florida tanner also went to bat against the florida schools safety portal a project to amass enormous amounts of data about students in an effort to predict and avert school

academics confirm major predictive policing algorithm is fundamentally flawed vice senators demand answers on the dangers of predictive policing transcript ora i had the opportunity to give public comment at the marjory stoneman douglas high school commission and theyre the committee thats responsible for the legislation thats being passed for school shootings because of what took place in parkland when i went up to the mic i actually felt somewhat intimidated because the entire room was all police officers and its all white males we were there to present our feedback regarding the florida schools safety portal which is a project they were starting that was just collecting massive amounts of data basically the portal was to predict the probability of a student being on the path to being a school shooter and so they thought using ai technology was a way to do this it was problematic because 58 of the students in the state are black and hispanic and its the majority of their information thats in those databases so if youre using those data sources its most likely its going to be a black or hispanic person thats going to get a high probability score cindy thats ora tanner shes an educator and an entrepreneur working to change how we understand data sharing and surveillance and especially its impact on young people jason oras going to talk with us about educating young people on artificial intelligence and how shes tackling the ways that algorithms both harm and empower young people this is how to fix the internet a podcast of the electronic frontier foundation im jason kelly a digital strategist at eff sitting in for danny obrien cindy and im cindy cohen effs executive director jason welcome to how to fix the internet cindy ora thank you so much for joining us today now before you started your latest venture you were a classroom teacher for a while and i think that woke you up to some of the issues that youre focusing on now can you talk to us about what happened and how you became committed to teaching students about ai and surveillance ora i have actually taught at every grade level from preschool through college but it was while i was at a school here in tampa where im located teaching eighth grade science and they just had all this different technology in all the classrooms but none of the teachers were really using it there were two things i noticed the students didnt really have any familiarity or experience with them which to me was very troubling because im like hey this is eighth grade you should have some minimal types of experiences with technology but then i also saw the power when i showed them like this is how it can be used you can use it to create so that inspired me to go back to school to pursue my phd in instructional technology cindy so how did you end up researching specifically ai and then surveillance ora during my phd work i had the opportunity to have a fellowship with the aspen tech policy hub out in san francisco during that time i really was taking just a deep dive into artificial intelligence then i got into algorithmic bias and then i just realized hey this bias seems to always be against the same group of people poor people black people women and so the first thing that came to my mind was my students and im like if my students dont know about this and how it works and what the plans are of the people who are creating this technology theyre just going to get slammed by the future and theyre not going to know how to navigate or understand and just in my head i had an image like if a students trying to get a job but they dont understand the bias and the application tracking systems theyll wonder hey why dont i ever get a call back or why does it it will just seem like some ubiquitous force that they wont really understand so thats when i got the idea to start creating a curriculum or learning experiences to teach students about emerging technologies especially ai jason and one of the things that youve found was there was a surveillance within the school system right something in florida in particular can you talk a little bit about that kind of surveillance that you found ora so as i was doing my research i came up on a project that they were working on in the state called the florida schools safety portal and i say that in air quotes so because parkland had happened a couple years prior so everyones on high alert but i guess in order to try to prevent that the solution at the state level was to create this database that just had massive amounts of data like their juvenile justice records or grades in school if theyve been suspended just different types of data from all these databases and theyre going to put it into one huge one which was just a lot of privacy concerns there the sharing of data across all these different organizations and agencies but they were going to use it to predict whether a child the probability of them being the next school shooter which is just mind blowing that they thought they would be able to do that just from a logistical point of view and so i was able to kind of bring a lot of attention to it and i even spoke at one of their commission meetings to just tell them hey these are the dangers of going down this route these are the unintended consequences these are the harms that could happen by trying to pursue this path of trying to stop school shooting cindy there are problems in kind of two ways and id love for you to unpack them for people because i think sometimes people think intuitively that this is a good idea and i think youve done a good job when ive watched you unpacking i think both sides like a it doesnt work and b its really dangerous in other ways as well ora a lot of times with solutions people just automatically go to technology because theres this misconception that technology fixes everything and we just have throw technology at it and most times people like policy makers are making these decisions but they dont have full understanding of how the technology actually works and so if they did they would probably make some different decisions and so thats what i was trying to do with the aspen tech policy hub like educate the policy makers and the lawmakers people in the department of education about it as well so with the florida school safety portal it was problematic because 58 of the students in the state are black and hispanic and its the majority of their information thats in those databases so if youre using those data sources its most likely its going to be a black or hispanic person thats going to get a high probability score so i try to do both sides like hey if youre going to attempt to do this this is what it literally would take to build a database and this is how the predictions would work this is the amount of data you would have to have this is the types of data you would need to have in this database in order for it not to be biased and to be fair thats if you are going to pursue it and on the other hand hey this is why this totally will not work and this is not a good idea jason so youve got this database and its got data from all these different sources for young people right its got information about i assume whether theyve been involved in a crime or whether theyve gotten in trouble at school and you put all that into a big system and then it spits out what like a number or like a sort of a precrime status for a student ora there really wasnt a lot of details shared with the public like just exactly how this was going to work and i showed up to some meetings i used the freedom of information act to get some information because it just wasnt freely available they had their presentation they did and with the graphics like hey its easy here are the things it goes to this one place were protecting students but the actual details were not very clear cindy weve seen this in the predictive policing context right where essentially the people whove gotten access to the way that the algorithm works and what its trained up on all it does is to really just replicate the decisions that the police are already making right so instead of predicting policing its predicting the police which is i suspect you probably had a version of that as well where the school officers who are flagging the kids that they always flag which we know has bias built in it and then this algorithm is looking at what the officers are flagging and then predicting that theyre going to keep flagging the same kids weve seen that kind of circular logic in some of the other things that are trying to predict whether somebodys likely to be a bad actor these kinds of predictive systems when theyre trying to predict like whether you want to buy shoes or something they have a massive amount of data and they have ground truth about whether somebodys actually buying shoes or has bought shoes in the past and one of the things that is always troubling in these kinds of trying to predict whos a bad person things is that they dont have nearly enough data to begin with so trying to train up a model to do this kind of prediction is always isnt going to work i know our audience anyway there are a lot of people who do understand how these models work and its important to bring that critical eye when youre trying to predict future behavior by humans it goes terribly wrong very quickly ora yeah i definitely agree especially if the school shooter even though its horrific that it happens just but just the numbers are so small so to try to do that and even the fbi theyve tried to look to see if theres any patterns among the people who have done it but the conclusion is theres not enough info and even if you did its like the thing with ai its youre always acting on historical data and so thats another big problem cindy yeah absolutely jason how to fix the internet is supported by the alfred p sloan foundations program in public understanding of science and technology enriching peoples lives through a keener appreciation of our increasingly technological world and portraying the complex humanity of scientists engineers and mathematicians jason one of the things that weve seen in florida is a lot of problems around pasco county in particular where weve looked into whats tended to be a datadriven policing strategy for young people there that sounds very similar or connected to the florida school safety portal what we saw there is theres a lot of harassment as a result of being labeled a potential x by these systems is there a similar kind of problem ora that was something they mentioned with the safety portal that they would be piloting a version but it was kind of like the room itself was all like police officers and i think there were a couple of lawyers so its literally a room full of white male police officers and so it appeared that they just had their mindset like hey this is the course were going to take we think this is going to work and i know also just at upper levels in our state it is the desire i dont know if it still is but to have florida be the leader in intelligent policing is some of the reports that i had read and i think thats whats playing out in pasco as you said i think a majority of the students are i mean the people being harassed are under the age of 18 and theyre just knocking on doors and checking on them in the morning late at night harassing their families and they havent done anything and so its just like well hey youre hanging out with these people and thats going to lead to this and its like where are you getting this from what is prompting you and what trigger is it thats causing you to come out to a students house who has not done anything cindy seeing this youve really thrown yourself into the solution of trying to educate students especially about this and why did you pick that particular solution and how are you seeing it play out ora tanner initially i just thought one it takes too long for legislative solutions to anything its just very very slow moving and i really just wanted to empower the students especially in the communities that would be impacted the most by algorithms which would be the black and brown communities so i wanted to attempt to give them some type of recourse and just a heads up like hey this is whats happening and the ability to push back and i just imagined say its happened a couple times already where people were misidentified through facial recognition systems and then sent to jail but if youre aware of how those systems work and how flawed they are and the inaccuracies you could push back and be like hey can i see the data how did you come to this conclusion and if they cant then you need to let me go and so i think just education is one of the easiest ways and most empowering ways to get information to students jason so one thing i think is really interesting about your approach im on the activism team at eff and we spend a lot of time killing bad bills bad projects bad legislation bad things that companies are doing but its not enough just to kill the bad thing right you have to educate people around how to do it better in the future and youre clearly doing that with this approach and im just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how this has been successful ora yeah i think as far as the policing and surveillance i know prior to the pandemic i was just on this education campaign and i was just trying to tell as many people as possible so i spoke to preservice teachers at university of south florida especially those who teach special education students so they would be aware of it i was just talking to other teachers and none of them were aware of it which was problematic so what im doing now i cofounded an organization called the ai education project and so i developed curricula to teach specifically high school students but now weve branched out into community college and college university students about artificial intelligence and its social impacts so the last couple of two semesters ive been teaching a course called the social impacts of artificial intelligence and we do talk about the florida safety portal and also whats happening in pasco county and so for their final project i do challenge the students to look at local based problems that have to do with ai and emerging technologies and bias systems and challenge them how would they redesign those systems and so i think its been really impactful so far because were educating a lot of students we started off with 300 in summer 2020 and as of the end of fall semester 2021 weve reached 30000 students with the large majority of them being here in the state of florida cindy thats fabulous and what i really appreciate about the approach is that youre really tying it to the local community and empowering the local communities and thats something weve heard throughout this podcast that the things that really work are the things that dont come top down and youre a highly trained scientist so in some ways youre the top of this but that really teaching the communities that are affected by a lot of these technologies and giving them the power to stand up for themselves and design systems thatll work for them i think that theres lots of ways in which computers and computer modeling could really help these communities and instead what were seeing are all of these things aimed at them by law enforcement or schools or other things and so i really love the approach of trying to flip this on its head and giving the power to the affected communities ora one i dont want students to be afraid of technology so thats one of my top number ones things i just want them to understand it and be able to make informed decisions but i also want them to know hey these are the problems the issues where its not getting it right so we have had some students that were so taken aback or just enamored with the whole thing that it has sparked them to want to go into this area and study it when they go to university or do something about it so thats the good byproduct of all of this like you cant solve problems that you dont know exist and so once youre aware if you feel deeply and passionately about it its like hey im going to do something about this and i also show students you dont have to be an ai engineer you dont have to be a programmer or developer to address this issue and so thats another part of the curriculum jason do students as youre telling this story about showing them how the specific assessment tools work in the criminal justice system for example are they surprised are any of them already aware of these or is it completely new to most people because i think i would be surprised if anyone really knew about it the average person probably doesnt but im wondering what their responses are ora yes in 100 of the cases they were just totally unaware of just all the different ways ai is being used how their datas being collected sold when theyre on these platforms and the interesting thing thats funny the course i teach at well the course in general is for everyone and the curriculums for everyone so we have students from different backgrounds but at the university its open to all majors and i always get the computer science students coming in and they come in with this hubris like oh i already know this i build models i whatever and then when we start going into this they had no clue no idea whatsoever but to me its not surprising because i think its only like 12 of computer science and data science majors even address ethical issues so before they were just coding they were making all the stuff and oh i can make it do this and that now i have to consider who may i be harming how is this going to be used how is this going to play out cindy id like to shift gears because our focus here is how do we fix the internet and i want to hear your vision of what it looks like if we get this right what if we flip the script around and we have technologies are actually serving communities that communities are in control of and that really work for students what do you see whats your vision ora what im trying to do now is just there needs to be some new narratives so right now the main narratives are owned by the big tech companies and academia so i just think if theres this spectrum so you have the technological utopians if you want to call them and thats more your big tech and your policy makers which are hey technology is the best it can do no wrong it can be used to solve any problem and then you have the technological skeptics which are more like your sociologists and people like that like hey its going to destroy us all its the worst thing ever and the people in the middle the contextualist hey it depends so i think most of what people see are on that one end that hey technology is great and theres a lot of hype around it and we dont actually look at the reality of it so i think just encouraging some new voices to talk about whats actually happening what are the effects and then if we can get those two ends of the spectrum to work together because we have these huge conferences where all the developers are at you have these other huge conferences where just the sociologists and that end of the spectrum but you never have one where theyre together to solve these problems so i would love to see that happen or just a more evenly distributed amount of information about the realities of the technology cindy if we had more evenly distributed information how would our world change how would a student in the future go through their experience thats different than whats happening today ora yeah well im actually seeing that now ive taught in the upward bound program students im teaching right now in my courses they are actually thinking before its like you download an app agree all they dont think about any of it but now i have my students are like omg theyre going to sell my information to third parties and theyre tracking me just making informed decisions also knowing were coming up on midterm elections theyre understanding the information theyre seeing is being targeted at them to nudge them they know what nudging is so hey i might have to go outside of my filter bubble to get some other perspectives on this so i think it would just make people more informed a culture of just searching for truth instead of just hey whatever you tell me im going to believe it cindy being back in charge rather than being manipulated by the way that the information is presented and by whom and where yeah that would be great ora yes cindy so what are the values we are protecting here already i hear self determination control ready access to information are there others ora yes one of my big things i just call it like tech equity diversity however it is diversity beyond just race and gender its also cognitive diversity so we need to hear from teachers we need to hear from sociologists we need to hear from young people when it comes to these different aspects of technology so i really push for as far as the tech equity piece i really push for black voices so there is a lot of awesome work being done especially in ai even in other things like metaverse black scholars but their work is never highlighted its always stanford berkeley mit and so theres great work being done at hbcus historically black colleges and universities and even with the courses i teach for my students im very careful not to only present western views because a lot of times we just get stuck in the united states and its like okay theres these other big land masses where they have people doing awesome work as well so yeah just that cognitive diversity coming from just a lot of different areas cindy do you have a particular thing that you do with your students that might give us a little more concreteness about what youre doing in your classes that would be fun to share ora we have them watch this video on how ai is being used in the criminal justice system like pretrial risk assessment and we have them to basically write a letter to the people who make the algorithm or on behalf of someone whos been wrongly accused or to the attorney whos doing the case as to why so weve gotten some really powerful things from that another activity we have them do is i call it pitch ai we ask them to envision a world how would they use ai to solve problems in a career or field that they care about and so weve gotten some really creative things of what people would do cindy give me an example id love to hear what people are thinking they would do ora we had a student she grew up in foster care like her and her sister and so she described how she would use ai to do better matching between a child especially when they have a sibling and the host family and so she describes this is the data that would be collected this is how the algorithm would work i had another student who was interested in political science and they talked about i think it was called dictator tracker how they would collect all this data on people who are running for office who do they have relationships with who are they corresponding with to predict the probability of them being a world dictator and so that one was kind of cindy that might be one hopefully we dont have enough dictators to train a model for that but i appreciate the effort jason and i like that youre taking youre literally turning the targeting of this ai against the powerful in some ways which its often being used against the powerless so thats really wonderful cindy so well that was terrific thank you so much for the work that youre doing i mean really honestly i feel like in some ways youre building the next generation of eff staffers and activists and go go go we need more and we especially need people from these communities right i mean its just not right that the people who are generally most impacted by these kinds of systems are the ones who have the least knowledge the least transparency and the least control i mean its just exactly backwards so thank you for the work that youre doing ora thank you so much for having me on this was great and fun cindy well i loved how she turned her horror at learning about the massive collection of data about students and the difficulties of trying to predict whos a school shooter from that and turned it into really a passion for helping to empower her community jason and i really appreciate that shes using it not just as an educational opportunity but as an activist opportunity shes really doing or having students do hardcore grassroots activism learning why these systems are the way they are how to fix them and then reaching out to people who make them to try to make them better i think thats really its a model for what eff does on the activism team and in general cindy i do think that the part where the students are not only learning how horrible it is but are learning how to write the letter to explain it to other people i mean thats the piece where the knowledge turns into power jason id love for her to have been a teacher in my school cindy id love her vision of a better future right its the stuff that were just hearing over and over again local control local empowerment real transparency and the simple truth knowledge is power jason absolutely well

    "tracking exposed demanding that the gods explain themselves imagine if your boss made up hundreds of petty rules and refused to disclose them but every week your pay was docked based on how many of those rules you broke when youre an online creator and your boss is a giant social media platform thats exactly how your compensation works algospeak is a new english dialect that emerged from the desperate attempts of social media users to please the algorithm that is to avoid words and phrases that cause social media platforms algorithms to suppress or block their communication algospeak is practiced by all types of social media users from individuals addressing their friends to science communicators and activists hoping to reach a broader public but the most ardent practitioners of algospeak are social media creators who relydirectly or indirectlyon social media to earn a living for these creators accidentally blundering into an invisible linguistic fence erected by social media companies can mean the difference between paying their rent or not when you work on a video for days or weeksor even yearsand then the algorithm decides not to show it to anyone not even the people who explicitly follow you or subscribe to your feed that has real consequences social media platforms argue that theyre entitled to establish their own house rules and declare some subjects or conduct to be offlimits they also say that by automating recommendations theyre helping their users find the best videos and other posts theyre not wrong in the us for example the first amendment protects the right of platforms to moderate the content they host besides every conversational space has its own norms and rules these rules define a community part of free speech is the right of a community to freely decide how theyll speak to one another whats more social medialike all human systemshas its share of predators and parasites scammers and trolls and spammers which is why users want tools to help them filter out the noise so they can get to the good stuff but legal issues aside the argument is a lot less compelling when the tech giants are making it their moderation policies arent community normstheyre a single set of policies that attempts to uniformly regulate the speech of billions of people in more than 100 countries speaking more than 1000 languages not only is this an absurd task but the big platforms are also pretty bad at it falling well short of the mark on speech transparency due process and human rights algospeak is the latest in a long line of tactics created by online service users to avoid the wrath of automated moderation tools in the early days of online chat aol users used creative spellings to get around profanity filters creating an arms race with a lot of collateral damage for example vietnamese aol users were unable to talk about friends named phuc in the companys chatrooms but while there have always been creative workarounds to online moderation algospeak and the moderation algorithms that spawned it represent a new phase in the conflict over automated moderation approaching moderation as an attack on new creators that help these platforms thrive the online creators association oca has called on tiktok to explain its moderation policies as oca cofounder cecelia gray told the washington posts taylor lorenz people have to dull down their own language to keep from offending these allseeing allknowing tiktok gods for tiktok creators the judgments of the services recommendation algorithm are hugely important tiktok users feeds do not necessarily feature new works by creators they follow that means that you as a tiktok user cant subscribe to a creator and be sure that their new videos will automatically be brought to your attention rather tiktok treats the fact that youve explicitly subscribed to a creators feed as a mere suggestion one of many signals incorporated into its ranking system for tiktok creatorsand creators on other platforms where theres no guarantee that your subscribers will actually be shown your videosunderstanding the algorithm is the difference between getting paid for your work or not but these platforms will not explain how their algorithms work which words or phrases trigger downranking as lorenz writes tiktok creators have created shared google docs with lists of hundreds of words they believe the apps moderation systems deem problematic other users keep a running tally of terms they believe have throttled certain videos trying to reverse engineer the system the website zuck got me for chronicles innocuous content that instagrams filters blocked without explanation the people who create the materials that make platforms like youtube facebook twitter snap instagram and tiktok valuable have dreamed up lots of ways to turn attention into groceries and rent money and they have convinced billions of platform users to sign up to get their creations when theyre uploaded but those subscribers can only pay attention to those creations if the algorithm decides to include them which means that creators only get to eat and pay the rent if they please the algorithm unfortunately the platforms refuse to disclose how their recommendation systems work they say that revealing the criteria by which the system decides when to promote or bury a work would allow spammers and scammers to abuse the system frankly this is a weird argument in information security practice security through obscurity is considered a fools errand the gold standard for a security system is one that works even if your adversary understands it content moderation is the only major domain where if i told you how it worked it would stop working is considered a reasonable proposition this is especially vexing for the creators who wont get compensated for their creative work when an algorithmic misfire buries it for them i cant tell you how the system works or you might cheat is like your boss saying i cant tell you what your job is or you might trick me into thinking youre a good employee thats where tracking exposed comes in tracking exposed is a small collective of european engineers and designers who systematically probe social media algorithms to replace the folktheories that inform algospeak with hard data about what the platforms up and downrank tracking exposed asks users to install browser plugins that anonymously analyze the recommendation systems behind facebook amazon tiktok youtube and pornhub because sex work is work this data is mixed with data gleaned from automated testing of these systems with the goal of understanding how the ranking system tries to match the inferred tastes of users with the materials that creators make in order to make this process legible to all users but understanding the way that these recommendation systems work is just for starters the next stageletting users alter the recommendation systemis where things get really interesting youchoose is another plugin from tracking exposed it replaces the youtube recommendations in your browser with recommendations from many services from across the the internet selected according to criteria that you choose hence the name tracking exposeds suite of tools is a great example of contemporary adversarial interoperability aka competitive compatibility or comcom giving users and creators the power to understand and reconfigure the recommendation systems that produce their feedor feed their familiesis a profoundly empowering vision the benefits of probing and analyzing recommendation systems doesnt stop with helping creative workers and their audiences tracking exposeds other highprofile work includes a study of how tiktok is promoting prowar content and demoting antiwar content in russia and quantifying the role that political disinformation on facebook played in the outcome of the 2021 elections in the netherlands the platforms tell us that they need house rules to make their conversational spaces thrive and thats absolutely true but then they hide those rules and punish users who break them remember when oca cofounder cecelia gray said that her members tie themselves in knots to keep from offending these allseeing allknowing tiktok gods theyre not gods even if they act like them these corporations should make their policies legible to audiences and creators adopting the santa clara principles but creators and audiences shouldnt have to wait for these corporations that think theyre gods to descend from the heavens and deign to explain themselves to the poor mortals who use their platforms comcom tools like tracking exposed let us demand an explanation from the gods and extract that explanation ourselves if the gods refuse",
    "the eu digital markets act places new obligations on gatekeeper platforms the european unions digital markets act dma is a proposal for bringing competition and fairness back to online platform markets it just cleared a major hurdle on the way to becoming law in the eu as the european parliament and the council representing the member states reached a political agreement the dma is complex and has many facets but its overall approach is to place new requirements and restrictions on online gatekeepers the largest tech platforms which control access to digital markets for other businesses these requirements are designed to break down the barriers businesses face in competing with the tech giants although the details are very different this basic approach is the same one used in various bills currently making their way through the us congress including the american innovation and competition online act s 2992 the open app markets act s 2710 and the access act hr 3849 this post describes the dmas overall approach and the requirements it places on gatekeepers one section of the dma requires gatekeepers to make their persontoperson messaging systems like whatsapp and imessage interoperable with competitors systems on request messaging systems raise a unique set of concerns surrounding how to preserve and strengthen endtoend encryption we walk through those issues here obligations for gatekeepers the dma only places obligations on gatekeepers which are companies that create bottlenecks between businesses and consumers and have an entrenched position in digital markets the dmas threshold is very high companies will only be hit by the rules if they have an annual turnover of €75 billion within the eu or a worldwide market valuation of €75 billion gatekeepers must also have at least 45 million monthly individual endusers and 100000 business users finally gatekeepers must control one or more core platform services such as marketplaces and app stores search engines social networking cloud services advertising services voice assistants and web browsers in practice this will almost certainly include meta facebook apple alphabet google amazon and possibly a few others the dma restricts gatekeepers in several ways including limiting how data from different services can be combined banning forced single signons and forbidding app stores from conditioning access on the use of the platforms own payment systems other parts of the dma make it easier for users to freely choose their browser or search engine and force companies to make unsubscribing from their core platform services as easy as subscribing was in the first place to improve antimonopoly enforcement the dma also requires gatekeepers to inform the european commission about their mergers and acquisitions the stick potential sanctions if a gatekeeper violates the new rules it risks a fine of up to 10 of its total worldwide turnover revenues even harsher sanctions are foreseen in the event of repeated or systematic infringement which could ultimately lead to behavioral or structural remedies these are significant remedies and the threat of fines at this level should be a strong deterrent a moving target there was a lot to like in the initial proposal presented by the eu commission in december 2020 but the dma has been in flux and the uncertainty continues right up to this moment for example at the last minute lobbyists pushed to have the dma include a remuneration right for the press which would have obliged search engines and social networks to offer publishers uniform payment tariffs for news content displayed on their platforms this was headed off by eff and its allies the political agreement will still need to be formally approved by the eu lawmakers once adopted the dma regulation will apply six months after entry into force expected in 2023 transatlantic impact many of the dmas provisions for addressing gatekeeper power on the internet can also be taken up on the other side of the atlantic the big tech bills currently making their way through congress in particular the open app markets act the american innovation and choice online act and the access act also seek to impose a set of requirements and restrictions on big tech that are intended to give space for competition these bills raise some of the same implementation challenges as the dma especially with regard to encrypted messaging apps but the need to address the gatekeeper power of our largest tech platforms is the same eff will continue to work with policymakers and enforcers to address these challenges an effective competition policy for the internet one that keeps users needs front and center will help align market forces and innovation to serve users security and privacy needs",
    "the eu digital markets acts interoperability rule addresses an important need but raises difficult security problems for encrypted messaging the european unions digital markets act dma allows new messaging services to demand interoperability the ability to exchange messages from the internets largest messaging services like whatsapp facebook messenger and imessage interoperability is an important tool to promote competition and prevent monopolists from shutting down userempowering innovation but an interoperability requirement for messaging services that are endtoend encrypted raises particularly thorny security and privacy concerns and those concerns need to be addressed before interoperability requirements are enforced against those services looking into these concerns will take yearsmuch longer than the text of the dma currently envisionsbut we have some thoughts on where to start the dmas interoperability rule the dma is a complex new law aimed at addressing the gatekeeper power of big tech firms while some of the final details of the dma are still in flux negotiators from the eu parliament and the council of the eu have reached a political agreement the drafters considered several proposals relating to interoperability including rules that would cover gatekeepers social networking services as well as messaging apps but the compromise between the eu lawmakers thats on the way to becoming law only includes an interoperability requirement for messaging apps specifically the giant gatekeepers will be required to make their messaging services interoperable with other messaging apps at the request of competing developers negotiators have agreed to assess the feasibility of including an interoperability requirement for social networking as part of a future review of the dma the dmas interoperability rule will apply to numberindependent messaging services that are part of gatekeeper platforms meaning platforms with the power to control other companies access to customers this probably includes messaging apps from apple google meta platforms eg facebook messenger whatsapp instagram direct messenger and microsoft of these only whatsapp apples imessage and android messages currently offer default endtoend encryption modes but these services together have billions of users these services will be required to make endtoend text messaging including various kinds of media attachments interoperable on request by a competing service within three months of a request group texts will need to be interoperable in two years and voice and video calls in four why interoperability matters recall that the goal of interoperability is to make it easier for people to leave big tech platforms for competing platforms without hampering their ability to communicate with anyone who chooses to remain within big techs walled gardens interoperability dismantles one of the biggest barriers faced by users who want to leave the tech giants platforms the choice between changing to a platform you prefer or staying behind on a platform where all your friends communities and customers are that gives new services a chance to competeby offering better protections for users privacy and security new features and better terms of service having multiple services for users especially vulnerable users to choose from may help protect against improper governmental surveillance and censorship and once users can easily stroll away from big techs walled gardens the market will give todays giants a much stronger push to treat their users right from continuing to improve users security to resisting governments demands for surveillance to eschewing surveillancebased business models messaging is a tough place to start while interoperability is important mandating it for encrypted messaging services presents some of the most difficult technical and policy challenges most critically interoperability obligations must not weaken endtoend encryption in services like whatsapp and imessage or undermine security in ways that otherwise break the promise of endtoend encryption such as adding clientside scanning of messages keeping that promise is particularly important because strong security and encryption are vital to protecting and preserving human rights not only does encryption in messaging enable the rights of expression and association for the users but it is also critical to protecting human rights defenders who depend upon strong security while opposing or exposing abuses in dangerous environments many security experts agree that requiring interoperability without unacceptable tradeoffs in security or privacy is a very high hurdle one that might turn out to be insurmountable not all of the challenges involved are strictly technicalplatforms are right to pay attention to combatting impersonation and maintaining usability so that the broadest possible range of users continues to have ready access to stateoftheart secure communications demanding that vendors of encrypted messengers figure out how to simultaneously open up their service to interoperators and maintain security is a tall order even though the demand is limited to very large wellfunded companies like apple and meta platforms facebook as applied to encrypted messaging interoperability could encompass a range of approaches from simply requiring users to be able to connect to a service with the client of their choice all the way to a fully federated model akin to email these approaches would have vastly different effects on security a technological solution that is simple to express in legislative terms can have unintended consequences such as creating incentives for companies to compromise on the security of users communications as with recent us proposals for law enforcement access to encrypted data policymakers need to safeguard users access to truly secure communications at the same time dominant companies should not be able to exclude rivals and maintain their dominant position by making badfaith claims about security requirements or by employing requirements that unnecessarily exclude smaller rivals security should not be used as a smokescreen to protect anticompetitive behavior this too is something weve seen before how the eu could get there the details of how the european commission implements the dma will make a huge difference in whether there can ever be secure interoperability in encrypted messaging eff has three initial recommendations first the implementing rules should strengthen the securityprotective exception for encrypted messaging the agreement reached by the eu lawmakers requires that [t]he level of security including endtoend encryption where applicable that the gatekeeper provides to its own endusers shall be preserved across the interoperable services this is an important requirement but it does not go far enough to avoid ambiguities implementing rules should clarify that the word preserved encompasses both ensuring that connecting services must live up to the gatekeepers level of security and allowing for continued progress in security and privacy the commission should make clear that any service that breaks the promise of endtoend encryption through any meansincluding by scanning messages in the clientside app or adding ghost participants to chatswill not be able to demand interoperability second making encrypted messaging interoperable simply cannot happen in the timeframe envisioned by the dma if it has any hope of resolving the significant technical and policy hurdles the dmas time limits on gatekeepers to provide interoperabilitythree months after a request in the case of onetoone encrypted messaging and within two years for group messagingare far too short by comparison meta platforms facebook announced plans to interconnect and encrypt three of its own messaging products in march 2019 and this project is still not complete getting interoperability right would require participation by a much larger group of stakeholders as part of a standardssetting and governance process and would therefore likely move at an even statelier pace based on the public text of this and other sections of the dma we hope that the commission will have adequate flexibility to delay enforcement of the interoperability requirementseven for very long periodsuntil security concerns can be fully worked out for endtoend encrypted messaging its worth taking the time necessary to ensure we get it right third gatekeepers and the commission need more tools to make good on their stated goal of preserving security in interoperable systems the dma says that the gatekeeper can take duly justified and strictly necessary and proportionate measures to ensure the preservation of security to implement this both gatekeepers and the commission should have the ability to request necessary information from third parties who seek to make their messaging apps interoperable to ensure that those services keep the promise of endtoend encryption interoperability requirements should not be enforced until any questions about users security have been resolved eff will carefully analyze the final text which is now subject to formal approval by the eu lawmakers once adopted eff will continue to engage with the european commission on the implementation of the dma and of course we will continue to monitor the actual realities of user experience for instance we will watch both for when dma requirements are being misused to undermine security and for when security requirements are being misused to undermine competition interoperability requirements on other services besides messaging such as social networks and app stores may be more feasible to implement in the short term at bottom while eff strongly supported and continues to support interoperability in the dma we recognize that the move toward it especially in the area of secure messaging requires care specifically we must ensure that our future ensures both strong security in messaging and robust competition to provide services to users or stated in the reverse we must ensure that we neither allow interoperability to be an excuse to reduce security nor allow unfounded claims of security needs to become an excuse to insulate a company from market competition while we are cleareyed about the challenge we are hopeful that we can meet both of these two critical values",

banning bypassing drm in order to infringe copyright for example in order to make thousands of copies of a dvd and sell them on the black market that has allowed companies to use copyright law to

    "11th circuits ruling to uphold injunction against floridas social media law is a win amid a growing pack of bad online speech bills theres a lot to like in the 11th circuit court of appeals ruling that much of floridas social media lawthe parts which would prohibit internet platforms from removing or moderating any speech by or about political candidates or by journalistic enterpriseslikely violate the first amendment and should remain on hold the decision is a win for free speech that stands in stark contrast with a 5th circuit court of appeals may 12 ruling allowing a similar constitutionally questionable texas law to go into effect while an emergency application to block the texas law is pending before the supreme court we filed a brief urging the court to put it back on hold we are relieved by the 11th circuits ruling in netchoice v florida the court recognized two crucial first amendment principles flouted by floridas law that platforms are private actors making editorial decisions and that those decisions are inherently expressive when platforms remove or deprioritize posts they are engaging in first amendmentprotected speech the court said tornillo shows the way florida sb 7072 signed into law by gov ron desantis a year ago prohibits large online intermediaries from terminating politicians accounts or taking steps to deprioritize posts by or about them or posts by journalistic enterprises defined to include entities that have sufficient publication and viewership numbers the law would override the sites own content policies florida passed the law to retaliate against platforms for supposedly censoring conservative voices interestingly the 11th circuit noted that the perceived bias in platforms contentmoderation decisions is compelling evidence that those decisions are indeed expressive first amendmentprotected conduct in ruling that the law likely violates the first amendment the 11th circuit pointed to the supreme courts unanimous 1974 ruling in miami herald v tornillo which established that the editorial judgements made by private entities about whether and how to disseminate speech are protected under the constitution in tornillo the court rejected a florida law requiring newspapers to print candidates replies to editorials criticizing them subsequent supreme court rulings protecting decisions by parade organizers and cable operators about what third partycreated content they disseminate further underpinned this free speech principle the 11th circuit said eff and protect democracy filed an amicus brief with the 11th circuit arguing that internet users are best served when the first amendment protects platforms rights to curate speech as they see fit free of government mandates that right allows for a diverse array of forums for users with unique editorial views and community norms the court agreed recognizing that by engaging in this content moderation the platforms develop particular market niches foster different sorts of online communities and promote various values and viewpoints we were pleased to see the threejudge panel use examples we cited in our brief to demonstrate the variety of communities platforms seek to appeal to through moderating content from facebook which removes or adds warnings to posts it considers hate speech roblox which prohibits bullying and sexual content and vegan forum which allows nonvegans but doesnt tolerate member who promote contrary agendas to proamericaonly which promised users no bsno liberals platforms arent mere hosts or dumb pipes florida argued that sb 7072 doesnt violate the first amendment because platforms dont review most posts before publication and therefore arent making expressive decisions as to user content but the law doesnt target speech that isnt reviewedit is specifically aimed at speech that is removed or deprioritized the court noted the panel also knocked down floridas argument that the law doesnt implicate free speech rights because it only requires platforms to host speech and not necessarily agree with it the court said that unlike the private entitiesshopping centers and law schoolsin the cases cited by the state social media platforms have expression as their core function which is violated by sb 7072 finally the court rejected floridas argument that large social media services are common carriersentities that in the communications context provide facilities so anyone and everyone can communicate messages of their own design and choosing while platforms sometimes say they are open to anyone in practice they have always required users to accept their terms of service and community standards so in reality social media users are not free to speak on the platform in any way they choosethey cant post comments that violate the platform rules the court noted the 11th circuit also cited supreme court precedent in reno v aclu where the high court said internet forums have never been subject to the same regulation and supervision as the broadcast industry further congress excluded computer services like social media companies from the definition of common carrier in the telecommunications act of 1996 florida cant just decide to make social media platforms into common carriers either the 11th circuit said declaring neither law nor logic recognizes government authority to strip an entity of its first amendment right merely by labeling it a common carrier borrowing language from our brief the court said social media platforms have historically exercised editorial judgment by moderating content and a state cant force them to be common carriers without showing theres a compelling reason to strip them of first amendment protections this is important because it recognizes that platforms have curated content since day one the court let stand at least for now sb 7072 provisions requiring platforms to inform users before changing moderation rules give users who request it the number of people who have viewed their posts and give deplatformed users an opportunity to retrieve their data eff had argued and the lower court had ruled that while some of these transparency requirements may be acceptable in another context they were impermissible here as part of sb 7072s overall unconstitutional retaliation the 11th circuit has drawn important lines in the sand but it wont be the last with lawmakers in georgia ohio tennessee and michigan considering similar bills its likely more courts will be called on to decide whether platforms have a first amendment right to moderate content on their sites we hope they follow the 11th circuits lead",

efforts to promote freedom of expression and create an enabling environment for innovation in a manner that balances the needs of governments and other stakeholders we recognize that theres a delicate balance to be struck between addressing the very real issue of platforms hosting and amplifying harmful content and activity while simultaneously providing enough protection to those platforms so that they are not incentivized to remove protected user speech thus promoting freedom of expression today as global efforts to change longstanding intermediary liability laws continue we now use a set of questions to guide the way we look at such proposals we approach new platform regulation proposals with three primary questions in mind are intermediary liability regulations the problem is the proposed solution going to fix that problem and can inevitable collateral effects be mitigated we are hopeful that policymakers will shift in the right direction on internet policy and affirm the important role of immunity for online intermediaries in fostering an enabling environment for users freedom of expression we outline our recommendations on how to do so below our recommendations online intermediaries should not be held liable for user content intermediaries are vital pillars of internet architecture and fundamental drivers of free speech as they enable people to share content with audiences at an unprecedented scale immunity from liability for thirdparty content plays a vital role in propelling the success of online intermediaries this is one of the fundamental principles that we believe must continue to underpin internet regulation platforms should not be held responsible for the ideas images videos or speech that users post or share online regulators should make sure that online intermediaries continue to benefit from comprehensive liability exemptions and are not held liable for content provided by users as they are not involved in cocreating or modifying that content in a way that substantially contributes to illegality any additional obligations must be proportionate and must not curtail free expression and innovation no mandated content restrictions without an order by a judicial authority where governments choose to impose positive duties on online platforms its crucial that any rules governing intermediary liability must be provided by laws and be precise clear and accessible such rules must follow due process and respect the principle that it should be up to independent judicial authorities to assess the illegality of content and to decide whether content should be restricted most importantly intermediaries should not be held liable for choosing not to remove content simply because they received a private notification by a user in jurisdictions where knowledge about illegal content is relevant for the liability of online intermediaries regulators should follow the principle that actual knowledge of illegality is only obtained by intermediaries if they are presented with an order by a court or similar authority that operates with sufficient safeguards for independence autonomy and impartiality no mandatory monitoring or filtering obligations for platforms to monitor what users share online have a chilling effect on the speech of users who change their behavior and abstain from communicating freely if they know they are being actively observed it also undermines users privacy rights and their right to private life policymakers should thus not impose obligations on digital service providers to affirmatively monitor their platforms or networks for illegal content that users post transmit or store nor should there be a general obligation for platforms to actively monitor facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity by users the use of automated filters that evaluate the legality of thirdparty content or which prevent the reupload of illegal content should never be mandated especially considering that filters are prone to error and tend to overblock legitimate material by the same token no liability should be based on an intermediarys failure to detect illegal content as this would incentivise platforms to filter monitor and screen user speech limit the scope of takedown orders recent cases have demonstrated the perils of worldwide content takedown orders in glawischnigpiesczek v facebook the court of justice of the eu held that a court of a member state can order platforms not only to take down defamatory content globally but also to take down identical or equivalent material this was a terrible outcome as the content in question may be deemed illegal in one state but is clearly lawful in many other states also by referring to automated technologies to detect similar language the court opened the gates of monitoring by filters which are notoriously inaccurate and prone to overblocking legitimate material reforms to internet legislation are an opportunity to acknowledge that the internet is global and takedown orders of global reach are immensely unjust and impair users freedom new rules should make sure that court ordersand particularly injunctionsshould not be used to superimpose the laws of one country on every other state in the world takedown orders should be limited to the content in question and based on the principles of necessity and proportionality in terms of geographical scope otherwise it is possible that we will see one countrys government dictating what residents of other countries can say see or share online this would lead to a race to the bottom toward creating an ever more restrictive and splintered global internet a worthwhile effort to put limits on the scope of takedown orders was done in the proposal for the eus digital services act it provides that court orders should not exceed what is strictly necessary to achieve its objective and pay respect to the charter of fundamental rights and general principles of international law regulate processes rather than speech instead of holding platforms accountable for content shared by users or forcing platforms to scan every piece of content uploaded on their servers modern platform regulation should focus on setting out standards for platforms processes such as changes to terms of service and algorithmic decision making accountable governance such as notifications and explanations to users whenever platforms change their terms of service can help reduce the information asymmetry between users and powerful gatekeeper platforms users should be empowered to better understand how they can notify platforms about both problematic content and problematic takedown decisions and should be informed about how content moderation works on large platforms privacy by default improved transparency and procedural safeguards such as due process and effective redress mechanisms for removal or blocking decisions can help to ensure the protection of fundamental rights online moving forward in the right direction we strongly believe that enforcing heavyhanded liability provisions on intermediaries for the content shared by their users hinders the right to freedom of expression this doesnt mean that we shouldnt consider proposals to reform existing regulatory regimes and introduce new elements in legislation that help address the fundamental flaws of the current online ecosystem for many users being online means being locked into a few powerful platforms nonconsensually tracked across the web with their ability to access and share information left at the mercy of algorithmic decisionmaking systems that curate their online lives policymakers should put users back in control of their online experiences rather than give the few large platforms that have monopolized the digital space more power or even oblige them to police expression and to arbitrate access to content knowledge and goods and services adjustments to internet legislation offer policymakers an opportunity to examine existing rules and to make sure that the internet remains an open platform for free expression while the trend towards stricter liability for online intermediaries has us dismayed it has simultaneously reinvigorated our commitment to advocating for regulatory frameworks that promote freedom of expression and innovation the other blogs in this

    "platform liability trends around the globe taxonomy and tools of intermediary liability this is the second installment in a fourpart blog series surveying global intermediary liability lawsyou can read additional posts here platform liability trends around the globe from safe harbors to increased responsibility platform liability trends around the globe recent noteworthy developments platform liability trends around the globe moving forward the web of global intermediary liability laws has grown increasingly vast and complex as policymakers around the world move to adopt stricter legal frameworks for platform regulation to help detangle things we offer an overview of different approaches to intermediary liability we also present a version of daphne kellers intermediary liability toolbox which contains the typical components of an intermediary liability law as well as the various regulatory dials and knobs that enable lawmakers to calibrate its effect fivepart continuum of intermediary liability liability itself can be distinguished on the basis of remedy monetary and nonmonetary liability monetary liability results in awards of compensatory damages to the claimant while nonmonetary liability results in orders that require the intermediary to take steps against wrongful activities undertaken through the use of their services usually in the form of injunctions to do or refrain from doing something monetary remedies are obtained after establishing an intermediarys liabilitywhich ranges from strict faultbased knowledgebased and court adjudicatedliability to total immunity various configurations along this spectrum continue to emerge as regulators experiment with regulatory dials and knobs to craft legislation tailored toward specific contexts the categories introduced in this section should be understood as general concepts as many regulatory frameworks are not clearcut or allow for discretion and flexibility in their application under strict liability regimes online intermediaries are liable for user misconduct without the need for claimants to prove any fault or knowledge of wrongdoing on the part of the intermediary as liability can occur even if the intermediary did absolutely nothing wrong strict liability regimes make intermediaries overly cautious they tend to conduct general monitoring of user content and minimize their exposure to claims by overremoving potentially unlawful material thus strict liability regimes heavily burden online speech by encouraging the intermediaries to censor speech even that which is not harmful faultbased approaches impose liability when the intermediary fails to meet specified due diligence obligations or a particular duty of care for example intermediaries may be obligated to remove certain types of content within a specific time frame andor prevent the reappearance of it the uks draft online safety bill for example imposes duties of care which are pegged to certain broad and potentially subjective notions of harm which are in turn likely to require platforms to engage in general monitoring of user content negligencebased liability as per the uk model takes a systematic approach to content moderation rather than addressing individual pieces of content the required standard of care under such liability approaches can vary on a continuum from negligence as established by the actions of a reasonable person to recklessness a substantial deviation from the reasonable action faultbased liability systems are very likely to effectively require a certain degree of general user monitoring and can lead to systematic overremoval of content or removal of content that may be undesirable but which is otherwise perfectly legal knowledgebased approaches impose liability for infringing content when intermediaries know about illegal content or become aware of illegal behavior knowledgebased liability systems usually operate via notice and takedown systems and thus typically do not require pervasive general monitoring there are different types of notice and takedown systems which vary in design and provide different answers to the question about what constitutes an effective notice what constitutes knowledge on the part of the intermediary is also an important question and not straightforward for example some jurisdictions require that the illegality must be manifest thereby evident to a layperson the eus ecommerce directive is a prominent example of a knowledgebased system intermediaries are exempt from liability unless they know about illegal content or behavior and fail to act against it what matters therefore is what the intermediary actually knows rather than what a provider could or should have known as is the case under negligencebased systems however the eu commissions proposal for a digital services act moved a step away from the eus traditional approach by providing that properly substantiated notices by users automatically give rise to actual knowledge of the notified content hence establishing a constructive knowledge approach platform providers are irrefutably presumed by law to have knowledge about the notified content regardless of whether this is actually the case in the final deal lawmakers agreed that it should be relevant whether a notice allows a diligent provider to identify the illegality of content without a detailed legal examination the manila principles developed by eff and other ngos stress the importance of court adjudication as a minimum global standard for intermediary liability rules under this standard an intermediary cannot be liable unless the material has been fully and finally adjudicated to be illegal and a court has validly ordered its removal it should be up to an impartial judicial authority to determine that the material at issue is unlawful intermediaries should therefore not lose the immunity shield for choosing not to remove content simply because they received a private notification by a user or should they be responsible for knowing of the existence of court orders that have not been presented to them or which do not require them to take specific remediative action only orders by independent courts should require intermediaries to restrict content and any liability imposed on an intermediary must be proportionate and directly correlated to the intermediarys wrongful behavior in failing to appropriately comply with the content restriction order immunity from liability for usergenerated content remains rather uncommon though it results in heightened protections for speech by not calling for greatly incentivizing or effectively requiring the monitoring of user content prior to publication section 230 provides the clearest example of immunitybased approaches in which intermediaries are exempt from some liability for user contentthough it does not extend to immunity violations of federal criminal law intellectual property law or electronic communications privacy law section 230 47 usc § 230 is one of the most important laws protecting free speech and innovation online it removes the burden of prepublication monitoring which is effectively impossible at scale and thus allows sites and services that host usergenerated contentincluding controversial and political speechto exist section 230 thus effectively enables users to share their ideas without having to create their own individual sites or services that would likely have much smaller reach the intermediary liability toolbox typically intermediary liability laws seek to balance three goals preventing harm protecting speech and access to information and encouraging technical innovation and economic growth in order to achieve these goals lawmakers assemble the main components of intermediary laws in different ways these components typically consist of safe harbors notice and takedown systems and due process obligations and terms of service enforcement in addition as daphne keller points out the impact of these laws can be managed by adjusting various regulatory dials and knobs the scope of the law what constitutes knowledge notice and action processes and good samaritan clauses in addition and much to our dismay recent years have seen some governments expand platform obligations to include monitoring or filtering despite concerns about resulting threats to human rights raised by civil society groups and human rights officials lets now take a brief look at the main tools lawmakers have at their disposal when crafting intermediary liability rules safe harbors offer immunity from liability for user content they are typically limited andor conditional for example in the united states section 230 does not apply to federal criminal liability and intellectual property claims the eus knowledgebased approach to liability is an example of a conditional safe harbor if the platform becomes aware of illegal content but fails to remove it immunity is lost most intermediary liability laws refrain from explicitly requiring platforms to proactively monitor for infringing or illegal content not requiring platforms to use automated filter systems or police what users say or share online is considered an important safeguard to users freedom of expression however many bills incentivize the use of filter systems and we have seen some worrying and controversial recent legislative initiatives which require platforms to put in place systematic measures to prevent the dissemination of certain types of content or to proactively act against content that is arguably highly recognizable examples of such regulatory moves will be presented in part three of this blog series while in some jurisdictions platforms are required to act against unlawful content when they become aware of its existence more speechprotective jurisdictions require a court or governmental order for content removals intermediaries often establish their own notice and action procedures when the law does not set out full immunity for usergenerated content under the eus ecommerce directive as well as section 512 of the digital millennium copyright act dmca which even sets out a notice and takedown procedure service providers are expected to remove allegedly unlawful content upon being notified of its existence in exchange for protection from some forms of liability such legal duties often put users freedom of expression at risk platforms tend to behave with extra caution under such regimes often erring on the side of taking down perfectly legal content in order to avoid liability it is far easier and less expensive to simply respond to all notices by removing the content rather than to expend the resources to investigate whether the notice has merit adjudicating the legality of contentwhich is often unclear and requires specific legal competencehas been extremely challenging for platforms intermediaries also exercise moderation by enforcing their own terms of service and community standards disabling access to content that violates their service agreements this is seen as good samaritan efforts to build healthy civil environments on platforms this can also enable pluralism and a diversity of approaches to content moderation provided there is enough market competition for online services platforms tend to design their environments according to their perception of user preference this could entail removing lawful but undesirable content or content that doesnt align with a companys stated moral codes for example facebooks ban on nudity as discourse is shifting in many countries dominant platforms are being recognized for the influential role they play in public life consequently their terms of service are receiving more public and policy attention with countries like india seeking to exercise control over platforms terms of service via due diligence obligations and with the emergence of independent initiatives which aim to gather comprehensive information about how and why social media platforms remove users posts finally the impact of notice and action systems on users human rights can be mitigated or exacerbated by due process provisions procedural safeguards and redress mechanisms when built into platforms notice and action systems can help protect users against erroneous and unfair content removals regulatory dials and knobs for policy makers in addition to developing an intermediary liability law with the different pieces described above regulators also use different dials and knobslegal devices to adjust the effect of the law as desired scope intermediary liability laws can differ widely in scope the scope can be narrowed or expanded to include service providers at the application layer like social media platforms or also internet access providers for example intervention with content does a platform lose immunity when it intervenes in the presentation of content for example via algorithmic recommendation in the us platforms retain immunity when they choose to curate or moderate content in the european union the situation is less clear too much intervention may be deemed as amounting to knowledge and could thus lead to platforms losing immunity knowledge in knowledgebased liability models a safe harbor is tied to intermediaries knowledge about infringing content what constitutes actual knowledge therefore becomes an important regulatory tool when can a service provider be deemed to know about illegal content after a notification from a user after a notification from a trusted source after an injunction by a court broad and narrow definitions of knowledge can have widely different implications for the removal of content and the attribution of liability rules for notice and action in jurisdictions that imply or mandate notice and action regimes it is crucial to ask whether the details of such a mechanism are provided for in law is the process according to which content may be removed narrowly defined or left up to platforms does the law provide for detailed safeguards and redress options different approaches to such questions will lead to widely different applications of intermediary rules and thus widely different effects on users freedom of expression in the next installment well

    "platform liability trends around the globe from safe harbors to increased responsibility this is the first installment in a fourpart blog series surveying global intermediary liability laws you can read additional posts here platform liability trends around the globe taxonomy and tools of intermediary liability platform liability trends around the globe recent noteworthy developments platform liability trends around the globe moving forward the vast majority of internet users around the world interact with online intermediariesincluding internet service providers isps search engines and social media platformson a regular basis these companies play an essential role in enabling access to information and connecting people across the globe and are major drivers of economic growth and innovation therefore the policies that intermediaries adopt to govern online marketplaces and platforms significantly shape users social economic and political lives such policies have major implications for users fundamental rights including freedom of expression freedom of association and the right to privacy the increasingly powerful role of intermediaries in modern society has prompted a host of policy concerns one key policy challenge is defining online intermediaries legal liability for harms caused by content generated or shared byor activities carried out bytheir users or other third parties we are concerned by the growing number of governments around the world that are embracing heavyhanded approaches to intermediary regulation policymakers today not only expect platforms to detect and remove illegal content but are increasingly calling on platforms to take down legal but undesirable or harmful content as well recent government proposals to address harmful content are dangerously misguided and will inevitably result in the censorship of all kinds of lawful and valuable expression harsher liability laws for online intermediaries encourage platforms to affirmatively monitor how users behave filter and check users content and remove or locally filter anything that is controversial objectionable or potentially illegal to avoid legal responsibility examples of such proposals will be discussed in part three of this blog series faced with expansive and vague moderation obligations little time for analysis and major legal consequences if they guess wrong companies inevitably overcensor stricter regulation of and moderation by platforms also results in selfcensorship as users try to to avoid negative repercussions for their artistic and political expression and without legal protection service providers easily become targets for governments corporations and bad actors who want to target and silence users the next few years will be decisive for the core rules that govern much of todays internet in this light we offer up this fourpart blog series entitled platform liability trends around the globe to help navigate the jungle that is global intermediary liability regulation we begin by providing some background information and exploring global shifts in approaches to intermediary liability laws in part two well unpack different approaches to intermediary liability as well as explore some regulatory dials and knobs that are available to policymakers part three will take a look at some new developments taking place around the world finally in part four well dig into effs perspective and provide some recommendations as we consider the future of global intermediary liability policy a brief history of intermediary liability rules lets start with a brief outline of intermediary liability laws the political context that gave rise to them as well as todays changing political discourses surrounding them generally intermediary liability laws deal with the legal responsibility of online service providers for harms caused by content created or shared by users or other third parties most intermediary liability regulations share one core function to shield intermediaries from legal liability arising from content posted by users the exact scope of this immunity or safe harbor varies across jurisdictions as will be discussed later in this series these laws acknowledge the important role online service providers play in the exercise of fundamental rights in todays society the need to create specific liability rules became apparent in the 1990s as internet platforms were increasingly sued for harms caused by their users actions and speech this trend of targeting internet intermediaries led to a host of problems from increasing the risks associated with investing in the fledgling internet economy to legal uncertainty for users and businesses and the fragmentation of legal regimes across countries and regions trying to counterbalance this trend lawmakers around the globe introduced safe harbors and other liability limitations for internet intermediaries in protecting intermediaries from liability safe harbor laws pursue three goals 1 to encourage economic activity and innovation 2 to protect internet users freedom of speech and 3 to encourage intermediaries to tackle illegal content and to take actions to prevent harm a shift in tonefrom liability exemptions to responsibility these goals are still highly relevant even though todays online environment is different from the one for which the early regulations were enacted today a handful of companies are dominant global players on the internet and have become ecosystems unto themselves there are many potential responses to the dominance of big tech at eff we have long advocated for interoperability and data portability as part of the answer to outsized market power liability exemptions are not a gift to big tech rather they ensure that users can share speech and content over the internet using a variety of services nevertheless some consider liability exemptions as giving an unfair advantage to the dominant platforms political discourse has also moved on in important ways internet intermediariesand especially social media networksare spaces where a considerable amount of public discourse occurs and often play a role in shaping discourse themselves in recent years major global events have catapulted social media platforms into the limelight of the publics attention including foreign interference in the 2016 us presidential election the cambridge analytica scandal the ethnic cleansing of rohingyas in myanmar the 2018 christchurch mosque shootings and the spread of misinformation threatening the integrity of elections in countries like brazil india and the united states as a result of the widespread perception by both the public and policymakers that companies responses to recurring problems like misinformation cyberbullying and online hate speech have been insufficient online intermediaries are under increased scrutiny this techlash has thus given rise to calls for new and harsher rules for online intermediaries recent accountability debates have shifted the focus towards platforms assumed obligations based on moral or ethical arguments concerning the public role of online intermediaries in a democratic society rather than focusing on a utility or welfarebased approach to liability limitations policymakers are increasingly moving towards a discourse of responsibility because so many people rely on them to communicate with each other and because they appear so powerful online platformsand in particular social media servicesare increasingly viewed as gatekeepers who have a responsibility towards the public good this expectation of intermediaries to respond to current cultural or social norms has led to two related policy responses both centering on the need of platforms to take on more responsibility an increasing reliance on corporate social responsibility and other forms of selfintervention by intermediaries and a greater push for legally requiring platforms to establish proper governance structures and effectively tackle user misconduct some suggestions center on the need for users platforms to take more effective voluntary actions against harmful content and adopt moderation frameworks that are consistent with human rights still more aggressive and dangerous policy responses consider upload filters and proactive monitoring obligations as a solution eff has long worked to provide guidance in response to shifting norms around this topic in 2015 we as part of an international coalition helped launch the manila principles on internet liability a framework of baseline safeguards and best practices based on international human rights instruments and other international legal frameworks in 2018 eff and partners then launched the santa clara principles on transparency and accountability in content moderation which call on intermediaries to voluntarily adopt better practices in 2021 a new version of the principles was developed with a focus on adequately addressing fundamental inequities in platforms due process and transparency practices for different communities and in different markets for this revision the santa clara principles coalition initiated an open call for comments from a broad range of global stakeholders feedback was received from allies in over forty countries and the second iteration of the santa clara principles was launched in december 2021 the current political climate toward intermediary regulation and changing market conditions could lead to a shift in the basic ideas on which current safe harbor regimes are based we at eff believe this may turn out to be a slippery slope w e fear the consequence of stricter liability regimes could be the loss of safe harbors for internet intermediaries reshaping intermediaries behavior in ways that ultimately harm freedom of expression and other rights for internet users around the world these themes will be explored in more detail in subsequent

    "how the federal government buys our cell phone location data over the past few years data brokers and federal military intelligence and law enforcement agencies have formed a vast secretive partnership to surveil the movements of millions of people many of the mobile apps on our cell phones track our movements with great precision and frequency data brokers harvest our location data from the app developers and then sell it to these agencies once in government hands the data is used by the military to spy on people overseas by ice to monitor people in and around the us and by criminal investigators like the fbi and secret service this post will draw on recent research and reporting to explain how this surveillance partnership works why is it alarming and what can we do about it where does the data come from weather apps navigation apps coupon apps and family safety apps often request location access in order to enable key features but once an app has location access it typically has free rein to share that access with just about anyone thats where the location data broker industry comes in data brokers entice app developers with cashfordata deals often paying per user for direct access to their device developers can add bits of code called software development kits or sdks from location brokers into their apps once installed a brokers sdk is able to gather data whenever the app itself has access to it sometimes that means access to location data whenever the app is open in other cases it means background access to data whenever the phone is on even if the app is closed one app developer received the following marketing email from data broker safegraph > safegraph can monetize between 14 per user per year on exhaust data across location matches segments and other strategies for us mobile users who have strong data records we already partner with several gps apps with great success so i would definitely like to explore if a data partnership indeed makes sense but brokers are not limited to data from apps they partner with directly the ad tech ecosystem provides ample opportunities for interested parties to skim from the torrents of personal information that are broadcast during advertising auctions in a nutshell advertising monetization companies like google partner with apps to serve ads as part of the process they collect data about usersincluding location if availableand share that data with hundreds of different companies representing digital advertisers each of these companies uses that data to decide what ad space to bid on which is a nasty enough practice on its own but since these bidstream data flows are largely unregulated the companies are also free to collect the data as it rushes past and store it for later use the data brokers covered in this post add another layer of misdirection to the mix some of them may gather data from apps or advertising exchanges directly but others acquire data exclusively from other data brokers for example babel street reportedly purchases all of its data from venntel venntel in turn acquires much of its data from its parent company the marketingoriented data broker gravy analytics and gravy analytics has purchased access to data from the brokers complementics predicio and mobilewalla we have little information about where those companies get their databut some of it may be coming from any of the dozens of other companies in the business of buying and selling location data if youre looking for an answer to which apps are sharing data the answer is its almost impossible to know reporting technical analysis and righttoknow requests through laws like gdpr have revealed relationships between a handful of apps and location data brokers for example we know that the apps muslim pro and muslim mingle sold data to xmode and that navigation app developer sygic sent data to predicio which sold it to gravy analytics and venntel however this is just the tip of the iceberg each of the location brokers discussed in this post obtains data from hundreds or thousands of different sources venntel alone has claimed to gather data from over 80000 different apps because much of its data comes from other brokers most of these apps likely have no direct relationship with venntel as a result the developers of the apps fueling this industry likely have no idea where their users data ends up users in turn have little hope of understanding whether and how their data arrives in these data brokers hands who sells location data dozens of companies make billions of dollars selling location data on the private market most of the clients are the usual suspects in the data trademarketing firms hedge funds real estate companies and other data brokers thanks to lackluster regulation both the ways personal data flows between private companies and the ways its used there are exceedingly difficult to trace the companies involved usually insist that the data about where people live sleep gather worship and protest is used for strictly benign purposes like deciding where to build a starbucks or serving targeted ads but a handful of companies sell to a more actionoriented clientele federal law enforcement the military intelligence agencies and defense contractors over the past few years a cadre of journalists have gradually uncovered details about the clandestine purchase of location data by agencies with the power to imprison or kill and the intensely secretive companies who sell it this chart illustrates the flow of location data from apps to agencies via two of the most prominent governmentfacing brokers venntel and babel street the vendor we know the most about is venntel a subsidiary of the commercial agency gravy analytics its current and former clients in the us government include at a minimum the irs the dhs and its subsidiaries ice and cbp the dea and the fbi gravy analytics does not embed sdks directly into apps rather it acquires all of its data indirectly through other data brokers few data brokers reveal where their data comes from and venntel is no exception but investigations and congressional testimony have revealed at least a few of venntels sources in 2020 martin gundersen of nrk beta filed requests under the gdprs right to know in order to trace how data about his location made its way to venntel he installed two navigation apps from the company sygic as well as an app called funny weather and granted them location permissions funny weather sold his data to location broker predicio which then sold it to gravy analytics the sygic apps sold data to both predicio and another firm complementics which sent data to gravy as well all of the data ended up inside venntels database in 2021 following a lengthy investigation by sen ron wyden broker mobilewalla revealed that it too had sold data to venntel gravy analytics shares some information about its locationdata practices on its website gravy claims it has access to over 150 million devices it also states outright that it does not gather data from the bidstream but government officials have told congress that they believe venntels data is derived both from sdks and from the bidstream and there is other evidence to support that belief one of venntels sources mobilewalla has testified to congress that it gathers and sells bidstreambased location data government contracts describe venntels dataset as containing data from over 80000 apps data brokers that rely solely on sdks like xmode tend to maintain direct relationships with just a few hundred apps venntels incredible app coverage makes it likely that at least a portion of its data has been siphoned from the bidstream venntels data is disaggregated and devicespecificmaking it easier for this data to point right to you motherboard reported that venntel allows users to search for devices in a particular area or to search for a particular device identifier to see where that device has been it allows customers to track devices to specific workplaces businesses and homes although it may not include explicitly identifying information like names or phone numbers this does not mean it is anonymous as one former employee told motherboard you could definitely try and identify specific people venntel has sold several annual licenses to its venntel portal a web app granting access to its database at a price of around 20000 for 12000 queries it has also sold direct access to all of its data from a region updated daily and uploaded to a governmentcontrolled server for a more lavish 650000 per year babel street is a government contractor that specializes in opensource intelligence osint services for law enforcement its flagship product babel x scrapes and interprets text from social media and other websites and merges osint with data gathered from more traditional intelligence techniques babel street is widely used by the military intelligence agencies private companies and federal state and local law enforcement it also sells access to appderived location data through a service called locate x as first reported by protocol in march 2020 babel street first registered locate x with the us patent and trademark office in 2017 the service allows babels clients to query a database of appderived location data locate x can be used to draw a digital fence around an address or area pinpoint devices that were in that location and see where else those devices went in prior months records obtained by motherboard from dhs reveal that according to a dhs official babel street basically rehosts venntels data at a greater cost and with significant constraints on data access babel street employees have also said venntel is the ultimate source of most of the location data flowing to the federal government that we are aware of although babel street has many publicfacing marketing materials it has attempted to keep details about locate x a secret terms of use provided by babel street to its clients ban using locate x data as evidence or even mentioning it in legal proceedings still several buyers of locate x have been reported publicly including the air national guard the us special forces command socom cbp ice and the secret service anomaly 6 or a6 also sells appderived location data to the government its existence was first reported by the wall street journal in 2020 a6 was founded by a pair of exbabel street employees brendan huff and jeffrey heinz at babel street the two men managed relationships with large government clients including the defense department the justice department and the intelligence community after striking off on their own a6 allegedly began developing a product to compete with babel streets locate x and catering its services to a very similar clientele in 2018 babel street sued the company and its founders and the two companies eventually settled out of court a6 presents very little information about itself publicly its website comprises just a company logo and an email address on an animated background it is not registered as a data broker in either california or vermont not much is known about a6s data sources either the wall street journal reported that it collects data via sdks in more than 500 mobile apps according to a 2021 report by motherboard these sdks are deployed by partners of the company not a6 itself creating a buffer between the company and its data sources a6 claims its contracts with the government are confidential and it cant reveal which agencies its working with public procurement records reveal at least one relationship in september 2020 socom division socafrica paid 589000 for a6s services in april 2022 the intercept and tech inquiry reported on presentations that a6 made in a meeting with zignal labs a social media monitoring firm with access to twitters firehose a6 proposed a partnership between the two firms that would allow their clients to determine who exactly sent certain tweets where they sent them from who they were with and more in order to demonstrate its capability a6 performed a live demonstration it tracked phones of russian soldiers amassed on the ukrainian border to show where they had come from and it tracked 183 devices that had visited both the nsa and cia headquarters to show where american intelligence personnel might be deployed it followed one suspected intelligence officer around the united states to an american airfield in jordan and then back to their home xmode is a location data broker which collects data directly from apps with its own sdk xmode began as the developer of a single app drunk mode designed to help users avoid sending embarrassing texts after dark but once the app started getting traction the company decided its real value was in the data it pivoted to develop an sdk that gathered location data from apps and funneled it to xmode which sold the data streams to nearly anyone who would pay its not clear whether xmode had direct relationships with any government clients but it has sold data to several defense contractors that work directly with the us military including systems technology research and the sierra nevada corporation it has also sold to hyas a private intelligence firm that tracks threat actors suspected of being involved with cyberattacks to their door on behalf of law enforcement and private clients xmode developed an sdk that was embedded directly in apps it paid developers directly for their data at a rate of 003 per us user per month and 0005 per international user xmodes directsdk model also made it possible to figure out exactly which apps shared data with the company by analyzing the apps themselves thats why the company made headlines in 2020 when motherboard revealed that dozens of apps that target atrisk groups including two of the largest islamic apps in the us muslim pro and salaat first were monetizing location data with xmode this visibility also made xmode more accountable for its behavior both apple and google concluded that xmode violated their developer terms of service and banned any apps using xmodes sdk from the app store and the play store at one time xmode boasted it had data from about 25 million active users in the us and 40 million more worldwide tracked through more than 400 different apps after the crackdown by mobile platforms the company was bought out and rebranded as outlogic and it adjusted its public image but the company is still active in the location data market its new parent digital envoy sells ipbased location services and describes its outlogic subsidiary as a provider of location data for the retail real estate and financial markets digital envoy also has deep ties to the us government the intercept has reported that digital envoy contracts with the irs enforcement division the dhs science and technology directorate which has also contracted with venntel and the pentagons defense logistics agency its unclear whether outlogics appbased location data is incorporated into any of those digital envoy relationships how is location data used while several contracts between data brokers and federal agencies are public records very little is known about how those agencies actually use the services information has trickled out through government documents and anonymous sources department of homeland security perhaps the most prominent federal buyer of bulk location data is the us department of homeland security dhs as well as its subsidiaries immigrations and customs enforcement ice and customs and border patrol cbp the wall street journal reported that ice used the data to help identify immigrants who were later arrested cbp uses the information to look for cellphone activity in unusual places including unpopulated portions of the usmexico border according to the report government documents explicitly reference the use of location data to discover tunnels along the border motherboard reported that cbp purchases location data about people all around the united states not just near the border it conducts those searches without a court order and it has refused to share its legal analysis of the practice with congress the federal procurement database shows that in total dhs has paid at least 2 million for location data products from venntel recently released procurement records from dhs shed more light on one agencys practice the records relate to a series of contracts between venntel and a recentlyshuttered research division of dhs the homeland security advanced research projects agency hsarpa in 2018 the agency paid 100000 for five licenses to the venntel portal a few months later hsarpa upgraded to a product called geographic marketing data western hemisphere forking over 650000 for a year of access this data was delivered on a daily basis via s3 bucketthat is shipped directly to dhs in bulk from context it seems like the venntel portal product granted limited access to data hosted by venntel while the purchase of geographic marketing data gave dhs direct access to all of venntels data for particular regions in nearrealtime the hsarpa purchases were made as part of a program called the data analytics engine dae in a statement of work dhs explained that it needed data specifically for central america and mexico in order to support the project elsewhere the government has boasted that ice has used big data architecture from dae to generate arrests seizures and new leads ice has maintained an ongoing relationship with venntel in the years since signing at least six contracts with the company since 2018 federal law enforcement the fbi released its own contracts with venntel in late 2021 the documents show that the fbi paid 22000 for a single license to the venntel portal but are otherwise heavily redacted another part of the department of justice the drug enforcement administration dea committed 25000 for a oneyear license in early 2018 but motherboard reported that the agency terminated its contract before the first month was up according to the wall street journal the irs tried to use venntels data to track individual suspects but gave up when it couldnt locate its targets in the companys dataset some of babel streets law enforcement customers have had more success protocol reported that the us secret service used locate x to seize illegal credit card skimmers installed at gas pumps in 2018 military and intelligence agencies military and foreign intelligence agencies have used location data in numerous instances in one unclassified project researchers at mississippi state university used locate x data to track movements around russian missile test sites including those of highlevel diplomats the us army funded the project and said it showed good potential use of the data in the future it also said that the collection of cell phone data was consistent with army policy as long as no personal characteristics of the phones owner were collected but of course detailed movements of individuals are actually personal characteristics another customer of locate x is the iowa air national guard as first reported by motherboard specifically the des moinesbased 132d wingwhich reportedly conducts longendurance coverage and dynamic execution of targets with mq9 reaper dronespurchased a 1year license to locate x for 35000 the air base said the license would be used to support federal mission requirements overseas but did not elaborate further anomaly 6 only has one confirmed federal client the us special operations command or socom in 2020 socafrica a division which focuses on the african continent spent nearly 600000 on a commercial telemetry feed from a6 in march 2021 socom told vice that the purpose of the contract was to evaluate the feasibility of using a6 services in an overseas operating environment and that the government was no longer executing the contract in september 2021 federal procurement records show that the us marines special operations command marsoc executed another contract for 8700 for sme support from a6 sme could stand for subject matter expert implying that a6 provided training or expertise finally the defense intelligence agency dia has confirmed that it too works with location data brokers in a january 2021 memo to senator ron wyden dia stated that it provides funding to another agency that purchases location data from smartphones on its behalf the data is global in scope including devices inside and outside the united states though the dia said it segregates us data points into a separate database as it arrives the us location database can only be queried after a specific process involving approval from multiple government agencies and the dia stated that permission had been granted five times in the previous two and a half years the dia claimed it needs a warrant to access the information its unclear which data broker or brokers the dia has worked with is it legal for the federal government to buy our location data in a word no the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and it requires particularity in warrants if the federal government wants specific location data about a specific person it must first get a warrant from a court based on probable cause of crime if the federal government wants to set up a dragnet of the ongoing movements of millions of identifiable people for law enforcement purposes too bad thats a forbidden general search the federal government cannot do an endrun around these basic fourth amendment rules through the stratagem of writing a check to location data brokers the us supreme courts ruling on cellsite location information or csli is instructive csli is generated as cell phones interact with cell towers its collected passively all the time from every phone that has cell service it is less granular than gpsbased location data and thus cannot locate devices as accurately the only companies that can access it directly are the phone carriers themselves in 2018 the supreme court ruled in carpenter v united states that csli is protected by the fourth amendment it also held that the government cant demand csli from telecom companies without a courtapproved warrant since 2018 all major us carriers have publicly committed to stop selling raw csli to anyone police do commonly obtain warrants for csli pertaining to active investigations courts also are beginning to crack down on geofence warrants for gps data from large companies like apple and google these warrants seek all the phones present in a particular time and place as eff has explained they are general searches that violate the fourth amendments particularity requirement one was struck down by a federal district court earlier this year in united states v chatrie federal purchase of location data about millions of people raises similar fourth amendment concerns with access to location data from commercial data brokers federal agencies can query data about the movements of millions or billions of identifiable people at once they are not limited to data about a single area or slice of time as anomaly 6 reportedly demonstrated they can start from a single time and place then look forwards or backwards at the location histories of hundreds of devices at once learning where their owners live work and travel agencies can make extraordinarily broad queries that span entire states or countries and filter the resulting data however they see fit it appears that this kind of fulldatabase access is what the dhs purchased in its 2018 deal with venntel this stretches the fourth amendments particularity requirement far beyond the breaking point in 2021 the center for democracy and technology published a comprehensive report on the legal framework underpinning the governments purchasing of location data it concluded that when law enforcement and intelligence agencies purchase personal data about americans they are evading fourth amendment safeguards as recognized by the supreme court eff agrees the fourth amendment should not be for sale sensitive data about our movements should not be collected and sold in the first place and it certainly shouldnt be made available to government agencies without a particularized warrant finally transparency laws in vermont and california require certain kinds of data brokers including those that process location data to register with the state of the companies discussed above xmode gravy analytics and venntel are registered in california but babel street and anomaly 6 are not these laws need better enforcement what can we do congress must ban federal government purchase of sensitive location information the issue is straightforward government agencies should not be able to buy any personal data that normally requires a warrant but legislatures should not stop there personal data is only available to government because its already amassed on the private market we need to regulate the collection and sale of personal data by requiring meaningful consent and we should ban online behavioral advertising the industry which built many of the tracking technologies that enable this kind of mass surveillance the developers of mobile operating systems also have power to shut down this insidious data market for years both apple and google have explicitly supported thirdparty tracking with technology like the advertising identifier they must reverse course they also must crack down on alternative methods of tracking like fingerprinting which will make it much more difficult for brokers to track users furthermore os developers should require apps to disclose which sdks they pack into their apps and whom they share particular kinds of data with both apple and google have made strides towards datasharing transparency giving users a better idea of how particular apps access sensitive permissions however users remain almost entirely in the dark about how each app may share and sell their data fortunately you can also take steps towards preventing your location data from winding up in the hands of data brokers and the federal government as a first step you can disable your advertising identifier this removes the most ubiquitous tool that data brokers use to link data from different sources to your device you can also look at the apps on your phone and turn off any unnecessary permissions granted to thirdparty apps data brokers often obtain information via apps and any app with location permission is a potential vector revoke permissions that apps do not absolutely need especially location access and uninstall apps that you do not trust",
    "effs flagship jewel v nsa dragnet spying case rejected by the supreme court we all deserve the right to have a private conversation online thats why eff has taken on government surveillance for the past 30plus years one of our longestrunning efforts has been to stop the national security agencys nsa surveillance that sweeps up tensif not hundredsof millions of innocent people in its dragnet our work will continue but today the us supreme court slammed the courthouse door on our flagship nsa surveillance lawsuit jewel v nsa effectively validating the governments claims that something known and debated across the worldthe nsas mass surveillanceis somehow too secret to be challenged in open court by ordinary members of the public whose communications were caught in the net the supreme court this week allowed our case to be dismissed because its a secret that the mass spying programs that everyone has known about since at least the snowden documents came to light in 2013 and disclosed in the national news long before that involved the nations two largest telecommunications carriers yes you read that right something we all know is a still officially a secret and so cannot be the subject to litigation specifically the court refused to take on and reconsider a ninth circuit decision and an underlying district court ruling that held that the state secrets privilege blocked our clients efforts to prove that their data was intercepted such that they had standing to sue the central fact that these courts found to be secret is that att and verizon participated in the mass spying even though we had submitted ample public evidence to support that finding the ninth circuit decision was so cursory that the court didnt even review the lower courts sealed opinion addressing the governments actual evidence of the spying despite the fact that the district court specifically required the government to present that evidence in secret in the name of national security the supreme court has now allowed the government to unilaterally cut off lawsuits like ours at the knees thereby preventing people from challenging egregiously unlawful surveillance as we said in our briefs the courts have now created a broad nationalsecurity exception to the constitution that allows all americans to be spied upon by their government while denying them any viable means of challenging that spying this exception prevents courts from even considering whether the surveillance violates the constitution or other privacy laws effectively denying americans their day in court and the benefits of the laws that congress passed to protect them the american people and our constitution deserve more from federal courts effs nsa spying cases first some history eff filed jewel v nsa in 2008 and our original case hepting v att in 2006 both cases arose from three different kinds of surveillance that the us government initiated in the aftermath of 911 first the mass telephone records collection program second the mass internet metadata collection program and third what we later learned was called the upstream program where the nsa with the help of the major telecommunications companies tapped into the internet backbone at key locations to monitor communications as they passed by and of course in 2013 after years of disingenuous denials by those in government edward snowdens documents helped make it crystal clear to the entire world that these programs existed pushed the government to admit them and helped spur some real reform more on that below and so much happened along the way in 2006 eff won in the district court against atts claim that the case must be dismissed along with collected cases against verizon and other telecommunications carriers and we defended that decision in the ninth circuit but in 2008 congress shamefully enacted retroactive immunity protecting the telecommunications carriers from the consequences of their rampant violations of federal and state privacy laws undeterred and promised by many in congress that their only concern was protecting the carriers we launched a suit directly against the nsa in jewel v nsa for the same three illegal mass spying programs an earlierfiled case against the government called shubert also survived later we launched another case first unitarian church which focused in on the right of association at issue in the telephone records collection portion of the nsa spying but jewel remained the flagship case initially the federal courts recognized that the law protected our case against several government attacks and the district court judge even ordered the government to present evidence of our standing in secret but ultimately and confusingly the lower courts changed course supreme court embraces national security secrecy as blocking the rights of victims the supreme courts rejection of our case is shameful but not surprising this term the supreme court had two other chances to bring some basic constitutional accountability to the national security state and it failed to do so first in abu zubaydah also called husayn the supreme court confirmed that in national security speak secret doesnt mean secret instead for purposes of the state secrets privilege secret means whatever facts the government wants to keep out of court by refusing to formally confirm them regardless of how widely known they are in abu zubaydah the supreme court allowed the government to claim the state secrets privilege over the fact that the plaintiffs torture which was admitted occurred in a us government black site in poland a fact that had been confirmed by the european courts as well as the former polish prime minister the supreme court allowed this claim of state secrets to block the plaintiffs attempt to get information from former government contractors via the international discovery process to support his claim against polish officials in the european courts the second case is called fazaga where the supreme court rejected the argument that congress preempted the state secrets privilege when it created a specific process in the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa found in section 1806f for handling the governments claims of national security secrecy in cases arising from alleged illegal surveillance fazaga is a case that arose out of an undercover fbi investigation by a confidential informant into a muslim community in southern california that was so alarming that the targets themselves called the fbi to report the informant as a potential terrorist in fazaga the supreme court held that despite congress express creation of a method for a federal court to secretly review evidence of claimed illegal surveillance the executive branch can just still unilaterally assert the state secrets privilege and prevent the fisa statute from actually being applied the jewel plaintiffs relied on section 1806f plus another statute 18 usc § 2712 that separately authorizes redress for illegal surveillance but the supreme court refused to recognize that congress intended to override the executive branchs ability to claim state secrets although we will still be on the lookout for ways to get the courts to stand up for your rights not to be spied upon by your government with these decisions the supreme court has fully endorsed the idea that the executive branch has unilateral authority to use secrecy arguments no matter how flimsy to close the courthouse doors for those seeking to vindicate their rights to have a private conversation no legal victory but lots of shifts in nsa spying while we did not prevail in the litigation the work we did and the millions of americans who raised concerns about the nsa spying over the years did result in some dramatic changes in nsa spying congress stopped the mass telephone records program in 2015 as part of the usa freedom act of course the revamped program still and predictably ended up collecting and keeping a huge number of telephone records a fact the government reported itself before the law authorizing the program expired the mass internet metadata program was stopped in 2011 allegedly due to congressional concerns that it wasnt actually providing any useable intelligence the upstream program continues however although it has been limited to just metadata it had included content review because of ongoing issues raised by the fisa court upstream is nonetheless still used to broadly surveil millions of americans with the government recently disclosing that between december 2020 and november 2021 the fbi queried the data of potentially more than 3 million us persons without a warrant the statute that purports to authorize upstream section 702 is set to expire in december 2023 many heros to thank we are forever grateful to our clients carolyn jewel tash hepting erik knutzen joice walton and gregory hicks who stood up for everyone in the us and who remained steadfast despite the many twists and turns of this case they understood how illegal the nsas spying was and were resolute in demanding their day in court we are grateful for their courage we are also eternally grateful to our whistleblowers most especially mark klein who first showed up at our door in 2006 and who at great personal risk brought us key evidence of the nsas spying he demonstrated that there was an nsa facility in room 641a of the att building on folsom street in san francisco a revelation that served as the centerpiece of the case mark also came with us to washington in 2008 to try to stop att from getting retroactive immunity from congress big thanks also to bill binney j kirk wiebe thomas drake and of course the indomitable ed snowden for sacrificing so much to try to bring the truth to america and the world they are our heroes and should be to anyone who cares about privacy wed also like to especially thank our cocounsel who were indispensable and unflagging despite years of ups and downs in the courts our team leader richard r wiebe shepherded this case along with help from thomas e moore iii jim tyre rip aram antaramian michael kwun additionally rachel meny benjamin berkowitz and and many other folks from the law firm of keker van nest peters llp helped in this long journey this case would not have been possible without all of their immense contributions the fight for your privacy continues finally though our challenge in jewel has ended the fight to end the nsas mass surveillance continues as noted above section 215 has expired although the government is allowed to continue using it in investigations that started before expiration nonetheless it should not be renewed and congress should push the government to end its use under preexisting authorizations equally importantly in late 2023 well have a chance to put an end to section 702 one of the key provisions that congress passed in 2008 to protect the nsas activities and which currently authorizes what is left of the upstream program congress should not renew section 702 next year year after year the inspector generals reports and fisa court review of the program find huge problems in its implementation the nsa simply cannot do this kind of mass surveillance consistent with the constitution its time for all of these gigantic ungovernable unaccountable and insanely expensive mass spying endeavors to end its time for americans to be once again allowed to have an online conversation without the nsa watching who they talk to when and for how long while the courts have abdicated their responsibility to protect you against nsa spying there is a good chance to push congress to scale back the nsas authority and well

    "facebook says apple is too powerful theyre right in december 2020 apple did something insanely great they changed how ios their mobile operating system handled users privacy preferences so that owners of iphones and other ios devices could indicate that they dont want to be tracked by any of the apps on their devices if they did apple would block those apps from harvesting users data this made facebook really really mad as far as apple and facebook and google and other large tech companies are concerned were entitled to just as much privacy as they want to give us and no more its not hard to see why nearly all ios users opted out of tracking without that tracking facebook could no longer build the nonconsensual behavioral dossiers that are its stockintrade according to facebook empowering apples users to opt out of tracking cost the company 10000000000 in the first year with more losses to come after that facebook really pulled out the stops in its bid to get those billions back the company bombarded its users with messages begging them to turn tracking back on it threatened an antitrust suit against apple it got small businesses to defend usertracking claiming that when a giant corporation spies on billions of people thats a form of small business development for years facebook and the surveillance advertising industry have insisted that people actually like targeted ads because all that surveillance produces ads that are relevant and interesting the basis for this claim people used facebook and visited websites that had ads on them so they must enjoy targeted ads unfortunately reality has an antisurveillance bias long before apple offered its users a meaningful choice about whether they wanted to be spied on hundreds of millions of webusers had installed adblockers and trackerblockers like our own privacy badger in what amounts to the largest consumer boycott in history if those teeming millions value adtargeting theyve sure got a funny way of showing it time and again when internet users are given the choice of whether or not to be spied on they choose not apple gave its customers that choice and for that we should be truly grateful and yetfacebooks got a point when users are hostages in facebooks comments to the national telecommunications and information administrations developing a report on competition in the mobile app ecosystem docket facebook laments apples ability to override its customers choices about which apps they want to run ios devices like the iphone use technological countermeasures to block sideloading installing an app directly without downloading it from apples app store and to prevent third parties from offering alternative app stores this is the subject of ongoing legislation on both sides of the atlantic in the usa the open app markets act would force apple to get out of the way of customers who want to use third party app stores and apps in the eu the digital markets act contains similar provisions some app makers upset with the commercial requirements apple imposes on the companies that sell through its app store have sued apple for abusing its monopoly power fights over what goes in the app store usually focus on the commissions that apple extracts from its software vendors historically these were 30 percent though recently some vendors have been moved into a discounted 15 percent tier thats understandable lots of businesses operate on margins that make paying a 30 percent or even 15 percent commission untenable for example the retail discount for sellers of wholesale audiobooks which compete with apples ibooks platform is 20 percent that means that selling audiobooks on apples platform is a moneylosing proposition unless youre apple or its preferred partner the marketdominating amazon subsidiary audible audiobook stores with iphone apps have to use bizarre workarounds like forcing users to login to their websites using a browser to buy their books then go back to their phones and use their app to download their books that means that apple doesnt just control which apps its mobile customers can use it also has neartotal control over which literary works they can listen to apple may have not set out to control its customers reading habits but having attained it it jealously guards that control when apples customers express interest in using rival app stores apple goes to extraordinary technical and legal lengths to prevent them from doing so the ios business model is based on selling hardware and collecting commissions on apps facebooks charges that these two factors combine to impose high switching costs on apples customers switching costs is the economists term for all the things you have to give up when you change loyalties from one company to another in the case of ios switching to a rival mobile device doesnt just entail the cost of buying a new phone but also buying new apps > [f]eebased apps often require switching consumers to repurchase apps forfeit inapp purchases or subscriptions or expend time and effort canceling current subscriptions and establishing new ones facebook is right apples restrictions on thirdparty browsers and the limitations it puts on safariwebkit its own browser tools have hobbled web apps which run seamlessly inside a browser this means that app makers cant deliver a single browserbased app that works on all tablets and phones they have to pay to develop separate apps for each mobile platform that also means that app users cant just switch from one platform to another and access all their apps by typing a url into a browser of their choice facebook is very well situated to comment on how high switching costs can lock users into a service they dont like very much because as much as they dislike that platform the costs of using it are outstripped by the costs the company imposes on users who leave thats how facebook operates facebook has devoted substantial engineering effort to keeping its switching costs as high as possible in internal memos published by the ftc the companys executives project managers and engineers frankly discuss plans to design facebooks services so that users who leave for a rival pay as high a price as possible facebook is fully committed to ensuring that deleting your account means leaving behind the friends family communities and customers who stay so when facebook points out that apple is using switching costs to take its users hostage they know what theyre talking about benevolent dictators are still dictators facebooks argument is that when apples users disagree with apple user choice should trump corporate preference if users want to use an app that apple dislikes they should be able to choose that app if users want to leave apple behind and go to a rival apple shouldnt be allowed to lock them in with high switching costs facebooks right apples app tracking transparency program the companys name for the change to ios that let you block apps from spying on you was based on the idea that when you disagree with facebook or other surveillancetech companies your choice should trump their corporate preferences if you want to use an app without being spied on you should be able to choose that if you want to quit facebook and go to a rival facebook shouldnt be able to lock you in with high switching costs its great when apple chooses to defend your privacy indeed you should demand nothing less but if apple chooses not to defend your privacy you should have the right to override the companys choice facebook spied on ios users for more than a decade before app tracking transparency after all like facebook and google and other companies apple tolerates a lot of surveillance on its platform in spring of 2021 apple and google kicked some of the worst locationdata brokers out of their app stores but left plenty behind to spy on your movements and sell them to third parties the problem with ios isnt that apple operates an app store its that apple prevents others from offering competing app stores if you like apples decisions about which apps you should be able to use thats great but thats a system that only works well and fails badly no matter how much you trust apples judgments today theres no guarantee that youll feel that way tomorrow after all apples editorial choices areand always have been driven by a mix of wanting to deliver a quality experience to its users and wanting to deliver profits to its shareholders the inability of ios users to switch to a rival app store means that apple has more leeway to take down apps its users like without losing customers over it the us congress is wrestling with this issue as are the courts and one of the solutions theyve proposed is to order apple to carry apps it doesnt like in its app store this isnt how wed do it there are lots of ways that forcing apple to publish software it objects to can go wrong the us government has an ugly habit of ordering apple to sabotage the encryption its users depend on but apple also sometimes decides to sabotage its encryption in ways that expose its customers to terrible risk like facebook apple makes a big deal out of those times where it really does stick up for its users but like facebook apple insists that when it chooses to sell those users out they shouldnt be able to help themselves as far as apple and facebook and google and other large tech companies are concerned were entitled to just as much privacy as they want to give us and no more thats not enough facebook is right that users should be able to choose app stores other than apple and apple is wrong to claim that users who are given this choice will be exposed to predatory and invasive apps apples objections imply that its often fantastic privacy choices cant possibly be improved upon thats categorically wrong theres lots of room for improvement especially in a massmarket product that cant possibly cater to all the specific individual needs of billions of users apple is right too facebook users shouldnt have to opt into spying to use facebook the rights of users shouldnt be left to the discretion of corporate boardrooms rather than waiting for apple or even facebook to stand up for their users the public deserves a legally enforceable right to privacy one that applies to facebook and appleand the small companies that might pop up to offer alternative app stores or user interfaces",
    "stop this california bill that bans affordable broadband rules the california senate energy utilities and communications committee will soon be the first to consider new and terrible amendments to assemblymember quirksilvas ab 2749which is backed by att and other telecommunications interests the legislation would prohibit the state from implementing affordable broadband rules for broadband companies receiving state subsidies as part of the new california infrastructure law sb 156 this is despite the fact that california taxpayersnot the industryare paying to build these networks an affordability requirement is crucial because this will be the only broadband access point for these californians and its likely they will be subject to monopolistic pricing practices a university of californiaberkeley study found that rural californians facing a frontier monopoly were paying rates more than four times higher than in areas with competitive markets under an att monopoly they paid rates more than three time higher on average americans living in areas with only one or two isps pay pricesfive times higherthan those in areas with competition in the market given what weve already seen in these areas across the state we can guess these are similar to prices that californians will face if ab 2749 becomes law take action california tell your lawmakers we need affordable broadband the bill would also undermine the federal fiber infrastructure plan the biden administration released in may by allowing inferior nonfiber solutions to be equally eligible for state subsidies this is a mistake federal and california legislators have made before wasting billions of dollars ab 2749 would prevent california from merging money from the states infrastructure plan with the funds from the new federal infrastructure plan to deliver highquality access to underserved and unserved populations because the federal law also requires states to establish affordability rules for broadband access california would be unable to fully leverage the federal funding if ab 2749 became law to read a detailed legal analysis of the legislation eff filed the following letter with the senate utilities committee eff also submitted this letter explaining why it makes sense to require fiber networks financed with public money to be subject to basic affordability rules passing ab 2749 would unwind the promise of californias infrastructure law to promote local affordable future proof access to the internet it would also undermine the amazing array of local efforts happening all across the state to deliver affordable solutions by allowing major corporations a chance to capture the dollars without conditions to stop that from happening we need california lawmakers to hear why you oppose

    "eff warns another court about the dangers of broad siteblocking orders a copyright holder cant use a court order against the owner of an infringing website to conscript every intermediary service on the internet into helping make that website disappear eff and the computer communications industry association argued in an amicus brief the brief filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york defends cloudflare a san franciscobased global cloud services provider united king film distribution a movie television sports and news content producer and provider sued the creators of israeltv which had streamed content on which united king held copyrights after the people behind israeltv failed to appear in court united king won a shockingly broad injunction not only against them but also claiming to bind hundreds maybe thousands of intermediaries including nearly every internet service provider in the us domain name registrars web designers shippers advertising networks payment processors banks and content delivery networks united king then sought to enforce that injunction against cdnreverse proxy service cloudflare demanding that cloudflare be held in contempt of court for refusing to block the streaming site and stop it from ever appearing again but the injunction is impermissibly broad at odds with both federal rule of civil procedure 65 and the digital millennium copyright act dmca effs brief argued its like ordering a telephone company to prevent a person from ever having conversations over the companys network it will cause collateral harm to numerous internet services and their users by imposing unnecessary costs and compliance burdens and it could cause intermediaries like cloudflare to block lawful websites and speech in order to avoid being sanctioned by courts in cases like this a copyright holder with an injunction simply cant conscript every internet intermediary to help cut every internet user off from accessing an infringing website in fact they cant conscript even one intermediary without fulfilling the laws requirements they would have to show that the intermediary acted in close coordination with the website owners more than just providing them a basic service and they would have to limit their injunction to the narrow guidelines allowed under the dmca including giving intermediaries a chance to be heard before being ordered to block weve seen this playbook before in 2015 we helped cloudflare get relief from a similar order that would have required them to play detective by finding and banning an infringing website owner whenever and wherever they appeared and of course the order in this case looks a lot like the kind of websiteblocking order that the infamous sopa and pipa bills of 20112012 would have enabled its preposterous to think that major media companies waged a giant expensive and ultimately losing battle for the power to censor websites if that power was allegedly available from the courts all along today we hope the courts understand that even if a website is infringing copyrights the law doesnt let rightsholders conscript the entire internet to help make that site go away the costs to innocent users rights is simply too high the case is 21cv11024 kpfrwl",
    "copyright small claims quasicourt opens heres why many defendants will opt out a new quasicourt for copyright with nationwide reach began accepting cases this week the copyright claims board or ccb housed within the copyright office in washington dc will rule on private copyright infringement lawsuits from around the country and award damages of up to 30000 per case though its billed as an efficient and userfriendly alternative to federal litigation the ccb is likely to disadvantage many people who are accused of copyright infringement especially ordinary internet users website owners and small businesses it also violates the constitution in ways that harm everyone even if this were a perfect process there is bound to be confusion when a whole new regime for demanding money springs up and the rules surrounding the ccb are far from perfect so we want to hear from people who are hauled before the ccb if you feel youve been wronged by the ccb process please email info@efforg and let us know its voluntaryexcept when it isnt the copyright office calls the ccb a voluntary system copyright holders can choose to bring infringement cases in the ccb as an alternative to federal court and those accused of infringement called respondents here rather than defendants can opt out of a ccb proceeding by filing forms within a 60day window if a respondent opts out the ccb proceeding goes no further and the rightsholder can choose whether or not to file an infringement suit in federal court but if the accused party doesnt opt out in time they become bound by the decisions of the ccb those decisions mostly cant be appealed even if they get the law wrong although cases will vary we think most knowledgeable parties will choose to opt out of the ccb processagain knowledgeable the concern about this system mostly hurting regular users website owners and small businesses that dont have staff who have been watching the ccb unfold cannot be understated every reason a knowledgeable party might decide to opt out is also a complicated legal issue that the average person should not be expected to know notsosmall claims damages awards at the ccb will be limited to 15000 per claim and 30000 per case thats smaller than the maximum statutory damages a federal court can award on an infringement claim which is 150000 but is 30000 per claim really a small claim its 44 of the 2020 median us household income its higher than the maximum damages allowed in the small claims courts of nearly every state and three years from now the register of copyrights can raise the ccbs damages caps even higherthe statute puts no limit on increases the damages caps also hide a big liability pitfall in federal court massive and unpredictable statutory damages are generally only available if the rightsholder has registered their copyright before the alleged infringement began without advance registration a rightsholder is limited to recovering the actual damages caused by the infringement which they must prove and which are often much smaller than statutory damages in practice that rule has limited the possibility of big payouts in a copyright lawsuit to works where the author has either made a small proactive effort to protect against infringement or that have significant market value the ccb though dispenses with the timely registration rule in ccb proceedings a rightsholder can recover up to 7500 in statutory damages per work without any proof of harm even if they register their copyright the same day they file a claim with the ccb that means nearly every photograph tweet scrap of prose or scanned scribble can potentially be the basis for a profitable ccb lawsuit even if it has no commercial value or even any personal value to the author it means that website owners and other internet users can face a ccp complaint even for lowvalue works that would never have merited a federal lawsuit and it means that in many cases opting out of ccb small claims proceedings will actually lower your financial risk copyright parking tickets the ccb will also have a worrisome smaller claims procedure for claims of 5000 or less for these claims proceedings will be even more informal and the responding partys ability to request evidence from the rightsholder to help in their defense such as records of copyright ownership and licenses may be extremely limited we suspect that responding parties will face significant pressure to settle claims for cashequivalent to paying a very large parking ticketwhere a more careful consideration would show that they have a valid defense such as fair use theres a real risk that even clear cases of fair use wont get their due in these smaller claims proceedings cloudy with a chance of prorightsholder bias congress handed the copyright office a monumental task creating the first federal small claims tribunal and the first such body with nationwide jurisdiction the rules that the copyright office has created over the past eighteen months strive for evenhandedness but they still wont do enough to overcome prorightsholder bias first the ccb is housed within the copyright office which has historically acted as a champion of rightsholders over users of copyrighted works a former head of the copyright office who now leads a publishing industry lobbying group famously said that copyright is for the author first and the nation second the office has close relationships with major media and entertainment companies including cohosting events and maintaining a revolving door of leaders who move between the office and these industries regulatory capture is a problem that affects many government agencies but its especially concerning for an agency that is now running a court second we expect that a relatively small group of rightsholders and rightsholder attorneys will be frequent flyers at the ccb while the responding parties will more often be firsttimers to this new tribunal all decisionmaking bodies tend to prioritize the desires of repeat players over new participants and the ccb will be no exception compounding this problem we expect that respondents who know the law well or have the resources to hire a lawyer will opt out of ccb proceedings so that the majority of respondents judged by the ccb will be people with less practical ability to raise the defenses that the law gives them this dichotomy could warp the ccb claims officers perceptions of all of the parties that come before them constitutional concerns the ccb was modeled in part on small claims courts at the state level but the ccb is different in a significant way its not part of the judiciary the copyright office sits within the library of congress which is part of the legislative branch the office is sometimes considered an executive agency but either way the constitution doesnt allow either the legislative or the executive branches to run courts that rule on disputes between private parties administrative law judges who rule on questions about what rights and benefits the government owes to people are a different story this restriction isnt just a technicalitythe independence of the courts is one of the most important protections for individual rights claims officers who are hired by and report to the register of copyrights cant truly render independent judgments this violates the constitution and is yet another reason why many people will opt out of a ccb proceeding the ccb has other constitutional defects as well for example the absence of a meaningful appeals process and the lack of a jury likely violate the fifth and seventh amendments and the ability to opt out doesnt necessarily cure these problems the staff of the copyright office are dedicated public servants and in setting up the ccb they are doing what congress asked of them but care and good intentions wont be enough to make this unprecedented judicial experiment fair or constitutionally sound as the ccb starts rendering decisions eff would like to hear from people who have been wronged by the process email us at info@efforg",
